              <h2>Much relief</h2>
              <p>Thank you for your reply which has helped a lot. I also phoned one of the therapists who gave you feedback on the website who has confirmed what you have said. We have been told in the past by a relationship counsellor that they had never
                heard of this issue before (this was before we knew of the word 'vaginismus') and I'm sure you can imagine the relief many years later when we stumbled a few weeks ago onto your website. Having this situation normalised is already starting
                to reduce the fear of it not ever getting better.</p>

              <p>
                I would like to start from the beginning of my vaginismus story. I'm a 27 yrs old woman. I got married in Jan 2007. Sexual intercourse for my husband and me was impossible for us due to the pain. I had taken biology but my practical knowledge about the
                anatomy was very low and so too was my husband's. We were very stressed and very disapointed with ourselves. My husband and I went to see a VOG and was prescribed a lubricant. It didn't work. Hopelessly, we went again to see the doctor
                and he suggested to stretch my vaginal opening by a small operation. We agreed and had it done at the end of January. We tried again &#038; again with different postures but the pain remained and the intercourse was still impossible. We
                stopped to see the doctor &#038; my husband and I decided to go through the internet for a more confortable lubricant and by miracle GOT YOUR WEB SITE! vaginismus.com. We immediately decided to order your complete kit. We got the kit at
                the end of March. I still can't believe our success! We got immense courage after having watched the DVD. I followed every step little by little. Started PC muscle group exercises at the end of March and continued for 2 weeks. I realised
                great progress in handling my PC muscle group. 3rd week, I was able to insert a Q-tip, then after succeeded to insert the 1st dialator to the 4th dialator!!! It took 3 months to get used to it thanks to God and to you! Today, 17th Jun
                2007, my husband and I were able to have our 1st intercourse by a full penis insertion!!! without any pain.... Your guidance and every blessings of others [in the forum] was the secret behind our success! I will definitely tell about this
                to our doctor and make him aware about vaginismus and give him a copy of your magical journal! It gave life to us and now, we're trying for a baby.... after 6 months of our marriage we were able to acheive the intercourse!(Jan-Jun) THANK
                YOU!!! Keep going with your magnificent service throughout the world and give hope and courage to every one who suffers from vaginismus! You will receive all our blessings! GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR COMPANY!!! from- K.N.S.S </p>

              <p>Dear Lisa, I wish you and your company all the best things to happen in this New Year. I got your vaginismus kit a month ago. Only 8 days I needed to resolve my 8-year-problem. I could not believe it. Therefore, I waited and I even repeated
                some steps to be sure that I was cured. It was so easy to have intercourse. Still I was skeptic, and I thought that maybe we are not doing it right. It was so hard to deal with the success. Thanks to your advice I knew that it was to be
                expected. I cannot find the words to thank you for your books, for your customer service and every advice you gave me. My life has a new beginning. We are planning our own family and our marriage has improved dramatically. Thank you!</p>

              <h2>Full hysterectomy</h2>
              <p>&hellip; I have now overcome my fear thanks to you all &hellip; what a wonderful life it is &hellip; I live in the UK and since a full Hysterectomy 10 years ago my sex life had gone from bad to worse &hellip; I was convinced there was something
                wrong with me. So I went to the GP for advice, they were very helpful and suggested an examination to make sure there was no medical reason - which there was not. But that was the end of the help &hellip; So after another frustrating year
                I decided it was time to take matters into my own hands. I did some research and came up with Vaginismus. The symptoms were everything I was experiencing. And after chatting to a friend who was using a dilator set decided that this was
                just what I needed. So I again went to the GP &hellip; who had no idea how to get one, but suggested I try counseling!!! I tried the Chemist, and local hospital suppliers - Nothing, so I tried the internet and of course NOTHING in the
                UK. so I clicked on a site in the USA - Bingo! Information, Sales and advice - Heaven. I sent a email to customer services asking about shipping to the UK - instant reply- this was great. For the first time in years I felt like I was on
                the verge of a new beginning &hellip; I chose my package, deciding that I should go for the [complete vaginismus kit] &hellip; After 9 weeks , I am already enjoying a much better and healthier sex life, and loving it. The fear has gone,
                yes there are minor hic-ups, but thanks to the team at Vaginismus.com I finally feel normal and more confident. I have passed the details to my local GP and Chemist [Pharmacist] in the hopes that someone else may benefit from my experience
                &hellip; Thank you again.</p>
