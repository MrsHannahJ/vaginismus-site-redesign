		<description><![CDATA[I am 25 years old, and I have never had a physically intimate relationship.  I want to use tampons and I cannot because of this problem.  I though the entrance to my vagina was blocked so I went to the Dr. When she put her finger up there my vagina clamped down and I felt sore for a couple days afterward. I am so glad I found this site.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am 25-years-old and deeply affectionate, but have considered going the rest of my life without serious romantic relationships, due to my inability to experience penetration. So many times, I&#039;ve tried and failed to have sex. Eventually, I started making up excuses to avoid getting into those situations and thought that I couldn&#039;t be helped. I cannot express how grateful I am to come across this website. Now, I can plan to find a solution, without feeling so embarrassed about it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was a virgin when I got married.  I had a very tough hymen which had to be broken by my  Gyn.  I was 20 when I got married.  I had two children, but intercourse was always difficult.  I am now 66 and for years I was celibate due to my husband being ill.  I am now a widow and have met someone in would like to be intimate with.  We tried and failed because I couldn&#039;t be entered.  It feels as though something is blocking my cervix.  He put me on a pillow and was able to enter a little but not all the way.  Thank you for this article.  I now have the name for this embarrassing condition.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My wife and I have been married for 3 years, and on our honeymoon I was expecting sex to be painful for her, because I had heard that the first time is usually painful for a girl.  (Although we got married at 27 we were both virgins)  Since then the pain has not lessened with sex for her.  It was rare in the first year for us to have sex with her not crying.  We believed through advice and research that this simply meant that I was too big and more intercourse would fix our problem.  Unfortunately, as I now know, sex with untreated vaginismus will cause the symptoms to worsen.  Without knowing this, we kept trying, and I applaud my wife for having sex with me despite the intense pain she had for the time we&#039;ve been married.  We even had a daughter 5 months ago.  However, now penetration is no longer possible at all without extreme pain on her part, therefore we have not had sex in a year.  I was so despondent about this fact that I searched and searched until I found out about vaginismus.  I told her about it, and when she looked it up on your website she agreed that this is spot on for her symptoms.  She ordered the kit, received it in the mail, and now the book sits next to her bed, unread, and the rest of the kit sits comfortably in its case.  I began reading the book, and she somewhat scolded me for reading a book that was for her.
I can understand that the years of painful sex have completely destroyed any desire to have intercourse in her.  I can understand that pain would make one avoid sex.  I can understand all of that, but now that a cure is in sight, how do I get my wife to try to work towards that cure, when the promise at the end of the journey, is something she knows only as pain.  How do you motivate someone to simply forget all they&#039;ve known about sex, and assume that every experience they&#039;ve ever had has nothing to do with how sex should be?  It feels like our marriage is a shell of what it should be.  For those of you reading this, I want you to know, if you want to fix this, it is entirely possible.  But if you don&#039;t want to fix this, please don&#039;t get your spouse&#039;s hopes up, and then do nothing about it.  It might just be more depressing now than before.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why is it that doctors don&#039;t seem to know about this condition?  I have been asking about painful intercourse for 30 years and was always told it was just my anatomy, and I was just small down there. I have completely lost interest in sex because it&#039;s so unpleasant. Had just one doctor I asked known about this, I could have had a normal sex life and still be enjoying sex today. To find out that this is a condition easily treated with high success rates makes me want to scream! If this was a condition affecting men, every doctor would know all about it and there would be TV commercials for treatments. I feel like I&#039;ve been cheated my whole life.]]></description>

I did endless bjs on him and had &#039;partial penetration&#039; with orgasm.And over the years he was not very sympathetic , and  I was too ashamed to seek treatment from the medical field , somehow thinking that they would think I&#039;m totally &#039;abnormal&quot;.. I suffered abuse ( especially emotional) but also sexual as he thought porn or 3somes would help??;( jover the course of our marriage and he had affairs throughout before he left altogether.

Am now in a relationship and am finding intercourse is very painful - more like not possible.  I tried medication given to me by my doctor - but found the side-effects scary.  Saw a gyno but overall they push the meds and then you are on your own.  I value this relationship and I have so enjoyed sex in the past, that I am looking for help ..... I&#039;m guessing this is vaginal atrophy - thank you for your site.....hg]]></description>
