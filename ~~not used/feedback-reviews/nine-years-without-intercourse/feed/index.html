		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so happy for you guys=). It&#039;s really refreshing to see that there actually are men out there, who really patientially and unconditionally support their wives in this.  Unfortunately, I had to end my four year marriage because of this condition. My exhusband wasn&#039;t very supportive and it was getting worse and worse for every year that went by. Sexual frustration can make people do bad stuff. I don&#039;t really know if I ever will meet somebody who will understand me and support me like you did for your wife.
I&#039;m really happy for you and wish you good luck in the future=).]]></description>
