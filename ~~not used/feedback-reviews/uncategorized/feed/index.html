				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just wanted to let you know that I have finally overcome vaginismus after 16 years of struggling with this condition.</p>
<p>Although my husband and I enjoyed a sexual relationship (outercourse as you refer to it), we were never able to achieve full penetration due to my muscle spasms. My husband could insert about 1/3 of his penis but then he hit &#8220;the wall&#8221;.  I have always used tampons and have had internal medical examinations so I knew there was nothing physically wrong with me.</p>
<p>Feeling frustrated on and off for years, I discovered your website and ordered your self-help kit.  It was the best thing I could have done.  I started straight in with the Kegels at 300 per day as I am a fit and healthy 37 year old. I then proceeded quickly through the 1st dilator and onto the 2nd.  I did my Kegels around the 2nd dilator to get used to it and that worked really well for me. However, I reached a plateau with the No.3 dilator and could only get that 1/2 way in.</p>
<p>I then decided to adapt the programme to suit me more and tried inserting my husband&#8217;s penis which I found less threatening somehow than the trainers.  Unbelievably, after only 9 days into the programme and on my first attempt I was able to fully insert his penis and have been doing so for the past 4 nights with greater and greater ease and comfort.  I have not experienced any muscle spasms and last night I was able to let my husband take control over penetration.  I am able to move slowly around him using the Kegel exercises and we now just have to discover how to enjoy full intercourse more.</p>
<p>I cannot begin to tell you what a diference your programme has made to my life.  My husband has been so understanding and patient over the years but I felt so frustrated and unwomanly!  I felt abnormal and used to look at other women and wonder why I couldn&#8217;t be the same as them.</p>
<p>To all vaginismus sufferers out there, try this programme and stick to it however hard you find it and whatever obstacles you may come up against.  Don&#8217;t give up because I never believed in a million years that I would achieve pain free sex in such a short space of time after all these years.</p>
<p>Thank you, thank you, thank you!</p>
