		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been suffering with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) for 6 years now and have always had trouble with insertion of tampons.I then got married and proceeded to have sex for the first time...sadly it was a lot less fun than I could&#039;ve ever hoped.I remember not having sex on the first night as even having a single finger inserted hurt like hell.  On the second night I decided to just brave it, and so I let my husband have his way with me. As he started the penetration itself I felt as if there was a barrier in the way regardless, I stayed silent and after slowly inching into me further... the barrier seemed to be ripping. The pain was unbearable  (like 21 on a scale of 1 to 10) and when he started to move I felt like he was pouring alcohol onto my torn and raw flesh. Anyway I stayed silent till it was over thinking it was just that painful because it was my first. It&#039;s been 6 months now and it doesnt hurt as much...but it does still hurt like a bitch. I&#039;m also often too dry Regardless of how turned on I am.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We are 60 and have been married 40 years. I guess it was four years ago when my wife said &quot;no more, it is too painful&quot;. I did not realize that she was in pain until then. She claims the pain is due to thinning of her vaginal walls, but will not ask her doctor about it. Even if that were so, I would not want to push her to use estrogen based products as we  both fear the side effects. There is some breast cancer in her family history, She always has required more than intercourse to have orgasm but very much enjoyed receiving oral sex. Now she has no interest at all and says that I should handle my needs through masturbation. That leaves me so hungry for physical contact, but she has no interest in even holding or kissing me. So much is said about communication, but if I even try to talk about this she gets angry and defensive. I do not get try to force the issue.. I know it just leaves her depressed. I doubt this will get better, but writing may
help so  I thought I would try as getting it out  feels a little better even if no one reads this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi I&#039;m in my mid twenties and I tried to have sex even though I knew it hurts when I do have sex. It never hurt before but in the last two to three years it&#039;s been hurting. So I thought it would go away. It hurts worse than before. I was crying it was unbearable and my boyfriend isn&#039;t that large. But I could even hold out for him.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m in my mid twenties and have had intercourse a total of 8-10 times. It&#039;s always been painful. I know I haven&#039;t had sex many times but the last time I had sex the pain was so excruciating I had to think about something else just to get through it. This is not normal to me. Also, I don&#039;t get aroused by any form of intimacy. And i can&#039;t wear tampons for more than 3 min cause they start to hurt...Idk what&#039;s wrong with me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have been having a real problem. Ever since I started getting my period I have had trouble with &quot;fitting&quot; things. To the point where had to use the slender ultralight tampons. Now have YEARS I finally worked up to regular and super if needed. But the real problem started when I had my first sexual intercourse. I new it was going to be painful. But not to extent it was at I tried to endure it and consecrate on the pleasure but eventually it got to hard to bare. I thought I just needed to get used to it and I would get over the pain. 2 years passed by and I finally had to courage to ask my gynecologist what to do. I had no hymen and she could find no cause to my pain. And she basically put me in a point of veiw that I would have to deal with this the rest of my life. Well 2 more years passed and I have pretty much given up having sex because it is too painful. And... I just do not know what to do. I feel like I will never have a normal sex life, I want kids. Will I ever be able to have them?]]></description>
