				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am really grateful that you created this website. Your website<br />
provides the best information about this condition. I finally found out last<br />
year that I have vaginismus. I did not know what was wrong with me and when I<br />
finally decided to go see a doctor, the first one absolutely had no idea. The<br />
second one diagnosed me with this condition. Unfortunately, soon after I lost<br />
my job and stopped treatment. I tried to start again but felt like I had to<br />
start all over again. I decided to do more research and came across your site.<br />
You have explained the condition in the best possible way and I understand what<br />
I am going through. I really hope that I can get past my fear and hope your<br />
book will help me through it. Thank you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am writing to thank you for your excellent kit and also offer a constructive<br />
criticism of the website.</p>
<p>I overcame vaginismus in about 6 weeks using your kit, and am very thankful for<br />
this.  I also found the forum extremely helpful, and still use it from time to<br />
time.</p>
<p>I have recommended your website to my GP and today to a top fertility<br />
consultant, who was very interested to hear of it and the success I have had<br />
with it.</p>
<p>I knew about your website for a long time before ordering the kit.  The reason<br />
I didn&#8217;t order it earlier is that the website gives the impression of a glossy<br />
advertising website which is selling something.  I assumed that if you are<br />
putting that much effort into selling it with all the photos of models then it<br />
must be a product that doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>There is no need for all these pictures of perfect people, as if you are trying<br />
to promote a product.  You are offering a very effective solution to a problem.<br />
No one would buy the kit unless they needed it, but it a shame to put people off<br />
buying it because it looks so over-promoted and advertised that it must be a<br />
gimmick.</p>
<p>I am British so perhaps the website does not give that impression to Americans,<br />
but from reading the forums I know I am not the only one who knew about the<br />
website for a long time before ordering from it.</p>
<p>The new testimonies and information on what the treatment involves go a long<br />
way towards giving the impression that this is actually a kit for real people<br />
with a real problem rather than a gimmick for supermodels, but I still think<br />
there is no need for all the glossy photos.</p>
<p>Once I got into the forums and saw that here were real people struggling as I<br />
was I had a completely different view of the website than I got from the glossy<br />
photos and advertising speak of the main pages.</p>
<p>Thanks again for a very valuable kit.  I hope the front pages of the website<br />
don&#8217;t put anyone else off buying it who needs it.</p>

I was starting to think something was wrong with me because I have a couple of friends that are also virgins and didn&#8217;t experience the type of pain that I did. I&#8217;ve been looking over the site, and I am relieved to know that there&#8217;s so much information available. I can&#8217;t thank you all enough for the work you all do with the site, it means a lot!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thank you for your reply which has helped a lot. I also phoned one of the therapists who gave you feedback on the website who has confirmed what you have said. We have been told in the past by a relationship counsellor that they had never heard of this issue before (this was before we knew of the word &#8216;vaginismus&#8217;) and I&#8217;m sure you can imagine the relief many years later when we stumbled a few weeks ago onto your website. Having this situation normalised is already starting to reduce the fear of it not ever getting better.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have not yet ordered the kit, but am so excited to do so.  After 11 years of a<br />
happy but unconsummated marriage, I am thrilled that there is hope.  When we<br />
were first married, the doctors who examined me had little to no knowledge on<br />
vaginismus. I actually had an operation a few months into our marriage that<br />
broke the hymen and was supposed to enlarge the area. Yet, still no<br />
penetration. I was then told that I was physically perfectly fine and that it<br />
was something in my head that I would have to overcome. Looking forward to my<br />
husband coming home tonight so we can order this together. Thank you for the<br />
site&#8230;.I am optimistic that you will soon receive a testimonial from me.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I would like to thank you for saving my marriage. Me and my husband have been<br />
trying to have sex for years and we would end up more and more frustrated every<br />
single time we would try. After a while we got sick of trying and trying because<br />
we would get no where!! We ended up to stop trying. We would just avoid that<br />
subject because we wouldn&#8217;t want to go through the disappointment again. I<br />
would cry and cry by myself cause I thought there was something wrong with me.<br />
I was scared my husband would cheat on me or leave me. I was devastated because<br />
he is the love of my life, he is my high school sweetheart. One day my husband<br />
comes home with a whole bunch of photo copies of your site on the internet. I<br />
started reading about vaginismus and stories of peoples lives that was my life.<br />
I was reading my life over and over again!!! I couldn&#8217;t stop crying of joy that<br />
I wasn&#8217;t the only one. That there was nothing wrong with me!!! I ordered the<br />
kit and I did exactly what it told me to do. 2 months later I was having sex<br />
with my husband and we were the happiest couple ever!!!! Thank you so much<br />
because right now I am 3 months pregnant with twins and I am the happiest woman<br />
alive cause this is what I have been waiting for my whole life, to become a<br />
mother. My dream has finally come true and we couldn&#8217;t do it without the help<br />
of the vaginismus site and the vaginismus kit!!!!!!!  Thank you again and<br />
again!!!!</p>
