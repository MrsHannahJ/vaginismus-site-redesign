				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just want to take a moment and personally thank you for doing what you do.<br />
This product saved my relationship. My husband and I have had problems having<br />
intercourse from the day we got married. While we were able to have partial<br />
inter course, it was painful and unpleasant. Our sex life was a big source of<br />
stress and pain for the both of us. While I had his support, I know my husband<br />
suffered greatly, and I couldn&#8217;t help feeling like a failure, and felt the guilt<br />
weighing down on me, knowing only I had the power toÂ fix the situation. A sex<br />
therapist diagnosed my condition, and a few months later, although we did not<br />
continue seeing the therapist, I decided to do my own research about vaginismus.<br />
At this point we were married for almost a year. I found your website and my<br />
life changed overnight. Just ordering the kit made me feel better, and more in<br />
control. Within one month we were able to have successful intercourse, and since<br />
then things have only kept improving. Now we are stronger and closer than ever,<br />
and we have you to thank. I will forever remember the impact this product has<br />
had on my marriage, my confidence and my self worth. Thank you thank you thank<br />
you!!!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> After six years of marriage, I was able to have sex for the first time with my<br />
husband two weeks ago thanks to your vaginismus treatment kit.  I blame my<br />
vaginismus on a conservative upbringing in a sexually repressed religious<br />
minority culture in the US.  Though my then-boyfriend and I had been sexually<br />
active via non-penetrative sex for years before marriage, the pelvic muscle<br />
spasms arose when we tried intercourse for the first time following our wedding.<br />
The shame and confusion led me to avoid seeking medical attention for years.<br />
Your self help treatment kit was exactly what I needed.  Going through treatment<br />
alone at my own pace, and watching gradual muscular improvement in myself as an<br />
athlete might see while training, were critical to success which took me six<br />
weeks from beginning to end.  I&#8217;m at a loss for words&#8230; The phrase &#8220;thank you&#8221;<br />
feels inadequate.  You have built mountains of good karma through your work.  If<br />
there is a God, God bless you.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> I started this program in June 2014. At the time I had not been able to have<br />
intercourse for 3 years. My marriage was not consummated and my husband was<br />
ready to leave. Now, 6 months later, our marriage has been consummated and we<br />
are starting over together. I suffered with vaginismus for 11 years. I had<br />
horrible pain during sex and eventually was not able to have sex at all. The<br />
disorder took a huge toll on me emotionally and physically and did the same to<br />
my partner. It eventually affected our relationship and communication, my self<br />
esteem and confidence. Vaginismus very nearly cost me my marriage. During the<br />
years, I had talked to doctors, gyns about my symptoms, but no one ever<br />
mentioned vaginismus. I found this word, diagnosis and this website on my own<br />
desperately researching what was wrong with me. After so many years of pain,<br />
frustration, failure and embarrassment, I was so relieved to find this website,<br />
a place that seemed to  finally diagnose me, but I didn&#8217;t know if anything could<br />
&#8220;fix&#8221; me, but I was willing to try anything.<br />
I took a chance and ordered the books and dilators.<br />
They absolutely changed my life and have helped salvage my<br />
marriage. I decided to also utilize professional therapy from a sex therapist to<br />
further help me, but I did the books and dilators on my own time and they, by<br />
far, are what have helped me most. It took me 6 months to get through the books<br />
and to graduate though all of the dilators, but now I can have intercourse and<br />
it is not painful. What couldn&#8217;t be done in all those years before, I did in 6<br />
months. It isn&#8217;t easy, but it is possible. If you really read the books, do the<br />
worksheets, the muscle exercises, watch the video and practice with the<br />
dilators, really follow the plan &#8211; you will see and make progress. Everyone will<br />
have their own time frame. Some will take more or less time than I did. But I<br />
honestly, can&#8217;t believe I am able to even type out this review after so many<br />
years of suffering. Thank you so so much for giving me my life and marriage back<br />
to me.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The reason why I&#8217;m writing this account is because this website helped me a lot<br />
and now I feel the need to help other couples. When I found out about the kit<br />
and I read the reviews, despite not having much hope, I thought I should give it<br />
a try. The kit took a few months to arrive because I ordered it from Brazil but<br />
as soon as it arrived I started the program. My boyfriend and I were both<br />
virgins when we first tried intercourse and our first attempt was very<br />
frustrating for both of us. Even though he tried to be careful his movement was<br />
rough and ended up hurting me, I think this contributed to activating my PC<br />
muscles to block the future attempts of intercourse, which were also very<br />
painful. I don&#8217;t think it was caused purely by this attempt, but also as a<br />
result of my physicological state that was worried about me getting pregnant &#8211;<br />
even though we were using the necessary contraception &#8211; at an inappropriate time<br />
in both of our lives. We tried intercourse for 4 months, till my boyfriend had<br />
to fly back to his country of origin. He told me that he had searched why we<br />
couldn&#8217;t have sex properly on online forums and I was doing the same when I<br />
found out about vaginismus and this brilliant website. It took me a while to be<br />
convinced I had it, but as soon as I was feeling sure about it, I let him know<br />
and he supported me. Even though we were living in different countries when I<br />
realised I had vaginismus I did the program, that has some parts dedicated to<br />
couples, by myself and I would always tell him how I was doing. This month,<br />
after almost 1 year of following this program, we were finally able to have<br />
successful intercourse. Now we are very happy and are sure that our sex life<br />
will continue improving with time and practice. So, thank you so much for<br />
putting work in a program that certainly is able to make people&#8217;s lives better.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My story began at a young age when I was forced to experience things sexually that I should not have been experiencing at that time. This affected me as it lowered my confidence self esteem. WhenÂ I found a very special man in my life, we started to have problems with painful sex. I saw gynecologists who told me there was no issue butÂ it started to affect us even more. I wouldn&#8217;t feel aroused or want to have sex but, because of past experiences, I felt I had to do it to be lovedâeven though my boyfriend constantly told me this was not the case. Three years into our relationship, we bought a house together and we thought things would get better but they seemed to be worse. We did some research and found vaginismus and all the symptoms matched so I ordered the books and dilators. I was very scared but I persisted daily and continued to feel jealous of people who didn&#8217;t have a problem and was ready for that to be me and to stop allowing past experiences to affect the now. I always felt I wasn&#8217;t good enough butÂ having goneÂ through the program, I grewÂ in relaxation techniques, self confidence and self esteem. Finally, I becameÂ pain-free but know this is just the start of my journey to better my life and not let things stand in my way. I am so grateful for the books and they have been a massive help. Thank you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> I&#8217;m writing to express my thanks to you for writing such a beautiful, loving, nurturing book that has transformed my sexual relationship with my husband. Together for 16 years, this &#8220;issue&#8221; which went without a name for about 15 years had us both feeling ashamed, blameful and hopeless. Finally named by a sex therapist we went to for a consultation, we found your book, and worked through it together, along with using the trainers. My husband went so far as to practice the pc muscle exercises with me as his dedication to being part of the solution. Our sexual relationship has been transformed, thanks to working through the book. We can now have intercourse when we choose &#8211; it still feels delightfully novel and wonderfully surprising to have so much freedom and ease, and no more shame, blame or pain!</p>
<p> Thank you for writing in such a manner that I felt able to let go of the shame and negativity, and dare to to take each step that was so carefully and supportively laid out. My husband and I are truly grateful!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am forever indebted to you. I don&#8217;t know what happened but I closed off to myÂ husband for 23 years&#8230; then he had affairs&#8230; and I fellÂ apart completely. All that love and we weren&#8217;t working intercourse-wise. I had aÂ book on vaginismus but it was all too psychological and made me just dwell onÂ myself for answers I never thought I&#8217;d find. I went to a doctor and he justÂ said, &#8216;There&#8217;s nothing wrong with you; women deliver babies though their vaginalÂ canal.&#8217; He didn&#8217;t mention anything about my PC muscle, biofeedback, that thereÂ might be others similarly situated. I left sobbing. As a last resort I searchedÂ the web, found you, ordered the kit and got down to work.</p>
<p>The first thing I loved were the people on the phone. So well-trained. CarefulÂ but direct. I just felt cared for from the very first contact. And you got me myÂ kit in England fast!</p>
<p>My biggest impression was from the declarations. I remember memorizing them andÂ when I went back to the book to look at exactly what was written, I rememberÂ thinking how each word was important; each word was there for a reason and itÂ said what it wanted to say exactly right. I loved those declarations. I feltÂ like whoever was responsible for the whole program just loved, well, me. It wasÂ like being taken by the hand and told I was OK&#8230; one step at a time&#8230; I am notÂ alone or even that terribly messed up. Mind over matter. I&#8217;m 57, had beenÂ defeated for over 20 years and was in a terribly emotional state when I orderedÂ your kit and you walked me right through!</p>
<p>So I write today because today was the day when I decided having sex with myÂ husband would not be about concentrating on my PC muscle (unless I hit aÂ glitch). Today was to look at my husband, breathe him in, smile, be in the<br />
moment and to start to really explore and enjoy this intercourse thing. And itÂ happened. I am delighted and filled with hope. I feel happy and normal, inÂ control and admittedly pretty emotional. It was easy and comfortable (not earth<br />
shattering), sweet, and good for us both.</p>
<p>I also remember thinking when I was reading your bookâeverything I had everÂ thought around vaginismus&#8211;about fears or myself etc. etc. etc.!âwas somewhereÂ in that book. You never offended or alienated or scared me. I&#8217;m a big strongÂ girlâI&#8217;m a lawyerâbut this was something I just couldn&#8217;t figure out.</p>
<p>The only critical comment I have is this: My husband&#8217;s penis is larger thanÂ your largest dilator (I always believed that was the problemâhis size). So IÂ just went to a sex shop and got a dildo/dilator that was the next size upÂ (well<br />
a bit more) and practiced the same way. I probably should have gotten 2Â gradations but they&#8217;re expensive and I thought I could do it.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I probably should have waited to write to you until I was less emotionalÂ to share all this with you but I&#8217;ve been wanting to say &#8216;Thank You&#8217; for a veryÂ long time. It took me closer to 3 months to get to where I am today but I really<br />
wanted to be sure I didn&#8217;t trigger pain/fear. I&#8217;m also grateful that the programÂ focused on the control of the PC muscle; not endlessly trying to figure out howÂ or why I shut down. It was so present and future focused which I found soÂ positive. (NB: I did everything you told me to do in that book. I didn&#8217;t skipÂ anything!)</p>
<p>So with all my heart to all of you, I thank you. I simply must sign this:</p>
