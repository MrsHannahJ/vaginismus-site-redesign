				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> I would just like to email to thank you for some of the vaginismus leaflets<br />
received by myself. I recently had emailed you regards this as I am a women&#8217;s<br />
health physiotherapist working within Northern Ireland.<br />
I have had a great response from patients re: your leaflets and plan to bring<br />
them with me to our next training date when more of the hospitals come<br />
together.<br />
I also wondered would it be possible to have any kind of sample of your book<br />
to potentially show to patients as they may find this beneficial?<br />
Much thanks again,<br />
Kind regards</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been practicing in NYC for 20 years and specializing in pelvic health<br />
physical therapy and manual orthopedics. I sent you positive feedback about your<br />
dilator set originally in 2006. Now it is 8 years later and I have found your<br />
dilator set to be one of the most valuable tools still that we recommend to<br />
patients.  Those suffering from vaginisumus, pelvic floor muslce dysfunction,<br />
sexual pain, and habitual clenching patterns truly benefit from using the<br />
dliators to perform at home stretches to reduce pain and improve their daily<br />
function.  Thanks again for a wonderful product and informative website.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thank you for writing these invaluable resources!<br />
I was diagnosed with vaginismus shortly before getting married in 2011. My husband and I are both psychotherapists, and we know professionally, and now personally, how devastating vaginismus can be. God greatly used your program to bring us deeper healing. I found your materials to be practical, effective and encouraging. My husband and I have recently written a book. In it we share our love story: our journey from singleness to marriage, and our struggles and victories with vaginismus. We pray that our story would bring couples struggling with vaginismus additional encouragement. We will continue to highly recommend all of your resources.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have treated women with vaginismus for over 20 years. Your products, and<br />
especially your books, are very helpful. They take the woman through a series<br />
of steps from education about vaginismus, exercises to prepare them for fixing<br />
the problem, and beyond. I use your materials, along with coaching women<br />
through difficult times and helping their partners understand what is<br />
happening, all with an excellent success rate. As you say, vaginismus is<br />
highly treatable. Congratulations on your most helpful work.</p>
