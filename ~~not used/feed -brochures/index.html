		<description><![CDATA[Comments/Feedback I have struggled with what I just learned this past Monday is called vaginismus, which has thwarted any intimate relations with my first and only partner since I met him many years ago.  In all past visits to doctors I&#039;ve always been told that I just had to &quot;relax more&quot; and that there was nothing wrong with me.  Fortunately, this past Monday I saw a new doctor who diagnosed me with vaginismus and referred me to your site and products.  I have been reading the very informative information on your pages, as well as the testimonials of previous sufferers who have been helped.  I am learning a lot from your site, have just ordered your treatment kit while also beginning work with a specialized Physical Therapist, and now have hope for the first time that I may someday (hopefully in the not too distant future) enjoy relations with my partner.  I find your site to be very well written and organized.  I also look forward to being able to participate in your forum once I receive my kit.  Thank you for providing such valuable resources.]]></description>
