		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m 38 and dismayed, as i have never used a tampon, an extreme fear of putting anything in me. Think it will be painful, not open eg blocked shut, and won&#039;t work. I forced myself to try after many goes at 24 but it was painful and i fainted. That was only penetration, and my only ever time. I have a learning disorder si wondered if it was that, or perhaps because i was brought up in a strict religious gone, or because I read when i was 14 that sex hurts and that possibly put fear into my psyche. Whatever it is i sense that other normal grown women would be shocked, even teenagers would say in not much of an adult. I want to be able to consummate my marriage to a sexy fiance in two years time. I feel ashamed that I&#039;ve never used a tampon and will be 40.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am 22. Ive been so close to having relationships but vaginismus is something ive had since my teenage years. It is so devestating for me and I feel like im the only one in the world with this problem. I have never been able to insert a tampon up me and even any attempt at penetration/intercourse has failed. It is soul destroying. I badly need help, and I dont want to live the rest of my life as a loner who shys away from men because of my anxieties about penetration. I have come across this website in the hope that I can start from here and be cured from this condition in order to be able to have sex and in the future have children. But right now I have no partner and never allowed myself to have one because I feel ashamed and embarrassed. I feel my vaginismus is both psychological and physical. I am gutted for anyone who goes through this, it really is tough. I dont feel comfortable saying it to my GP either. I feel it is not a common enough problem in Ireland. I need help...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I found this site over a year ago and it has already helped me so much. The kit is excellent and knowing that other ladies are going through a similar experience really helps on an emotional and psychological level. When I first received the kit, the thought of using the dilators filled me with dread -- I honestly couldn&#039;t see how I would use the first one, let alone get to the fifth. I was so scared and my anxiety was sky high. I put it off for months before plucking up the courage to try. A year on, I have progressed through the whole kit and last week was able to have a smear test for the very first time -- the test was not painful and I am just so happy I have been able to reach this personal milestone. I truly know how difficult it is and can really relate to everyone&#039;s stories. The key is to hang in there and practice, practice, practice. You are not alone and you will get through this!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am reading though this and am relating to so many comments.  I have been with my now husband for 10 years and never penetration.  I am a 34 year old married virgin.  I have an amazing patient husband however it does greatly upset him.  I really feel if I could just have sex our relationship would be complete, we would love to start a family and are the last of all our friends and family to do so, I have never spoken to a doctor that understands, they all say you are fine, just have a glass of wine etc and relax.  How can you relax when you are so anxious it makes you sick and you feel like a failure.  I have hope and can&#039;t wait for the day when I can say I am not a virgin. I wish everyone with vagimus all the best and with support I hope we can all get through this.  I have recently come close (he had 2 fingers in me!!) but as soon as it has been a few days I am back to square one.  We both work long hours and find it hard to find the quality time together.  I find the pressure eases when I am on this site.  We are not alone, and we will get through this. Thank you for this site.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I must have had this all my life &#038; thought I just had a very tough hymen (I might as well have a tough hymen along with vaginismus I&#039;m not sure) &#038; all the sites saying that breaking the hymen doesn&#039;t really hurt if you&#039;re careful just made me feel worse. I&#039;ve never ever been able to wear tampons even with lube because it hurt so bad. When I&#039;ve gotten a yeast infections &#038; had to insert the suppositories it was god awful because I couldn&#039;t get it very deep because it hurt so bad &#038; like it says on here I kept &quot;hitting a wall&quot; so I had to stay lying down for the medicine to dissolve &#038; work. And when I say pain I mean PAIN.

I&#039;ve never been sexually involved with anyone &#038; I can&#039;t imagine feeling pleasure from intercourse or fingers or toys etc because I can&#039;t imagine anything going in there without pain &#038; or hitting that wall. Even when I&#039;ve masturbated &#038; been relaxed &#038; stretched &#038; wet down there when I tried to put my fingers in I still hit that wall &#038; felt pain.

I&#039;ve never had a pelvic exam &#038; can imagine my dread of anything going up there will make it a nightmare. I really didn&#039;t know this was a thing until now &#038; I&#039;m so happy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had problems with my exams, since I was 17. I have painful periods, I have trouble putting anything: tampons, douches, my finger(s) in my vagina.

I still get tense during my exams( I try to relax mind/my body) I&#039;m single, I pray and hope I get through this tramatic period... I&#039;ve been laughned at/talked about and I&#039;m tired of it. (HELP)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m trying to decide if this can possibly be my problem. I am 60 years old, been married for 30 years and have 2 grown children. I have never had any issues with painful intercourse until the past 2 years. I had a vaginal hysterectomy and bladder repair. 10 months later I had another vaginal surgery, a rectocele and episiotomy repair, which I&#039;m afraid was overdone. Intercourse has been extremely painful for me and painful for my spouse as well. Reading the comments on here, I haven&#039;t found anyone with my issues. I don&#039;t want to purchase something that cannot help me.]]></description>
