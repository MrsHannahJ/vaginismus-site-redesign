          <h3>Ordering FAQs</h3>
          <h4>What currency is used for billing when I order? How can I calculate the conversion?</h4>
          <p>All prices quoted are in U.S. dollars. At the time of ordering, your credit card company will automatically perform the conversion for you. If you want to roughly calculate the currency conversion in advance, you can use this <a href="http://www.xe.com/" target="_blank">free calculator</a>.</p>

          <h4>What payment methods do you accept?</h4>
          <p>Placing an order online by credit card or by calling the toll-free number are the two fastest and most efficient methods of placing orders. We accept payment by Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, PayPal, and can also process manual orders via Western Union money wires and mailed U.S. dollar money orders (guaranteed checks or other money instruments). Contact us regarding any manual order request for more information.</p>

          <h4>What is PayPal? How does it work?</h4>
          <p>For those who are unable or do not wish to pay directly with a major credit card, <a href="http://paypal.com/" target="_blank">PayPal</a> is a popular alternate secure online payment processing method. PayPal allows users to pay using a number of different methods including bank accounts, various credit cards, and other options. With a PayPal account, you can order our products online by simply choosing this as your payment option.</p>

          <h4>How do I place an order if I do not have a credit card?</h4>
          <p>Besides credit cards, we do accept other methods of payment: PayPal (online account or e-checks), U.S. dollar money order (guaranteed checks or other money instruments), or Western Union wire transfers. To request one of these last two services, please <a href="../../../contact-us/index.html">contact us</a> directly. We do our utmost to ensure that a workable solution can be met for all women who are in need.</p>

          <h4>I am concerned about ordering over the Internet. Is your site secure?</h4>
          <p>Yes, we use the highest available security methods for your complete peace of mind. Norton Symantec is a recognized leader in Internet merchant security and provides the complete encryption and security for our online store.</p>

          <h3>Return FAQs</h3>
          <h4>Can I return the dilators for a refund if I donâ€™t use them?</h4>
          <p>No, we are not able to accept returns on the vaginal dilator product. For health and safety reasons, and also to comply with FDA regulations for vaginal inserts, vaginal dilators that have been sold to a consumer cannot be restocked and are prohibited from resale.</p>

          <h4>What is the return policy for unopened books or videos?</h4>
          <p>You may return any unused books or DVDs within 30 days in the original packaging for a full credit, minus shipping/handling charges and restocking fee of $10.00. To request this service please contact us directly.</p>
