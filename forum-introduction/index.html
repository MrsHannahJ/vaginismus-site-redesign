          <h2>Newcomers Welcome</h2>
          <p>Any woman who joins the forum can feel free to post her questions or concerns anonymously by using the screen name of her choice. Some women silently read the posts of others for encouragement and some become active participants in the many encouraging thread discussions.</p>

          <h2>Live Chat</h2>
          <p>The forum also has a chat room for women to connect on a more personal level. Women from around the world with vaginismus can chat about their lives or ask questions about treatment. We find that even in anonymity, as women begin to open up about their problem, they become more positive about the condition of vaginismus because they no longer feel as isolated.</p>

            <p><strong>We have started practicing the real thing!</strong> It took me a long time to get started due to lack of time and because I felt that my case wasn’t serious. The program and forum has definitely helped a lot! I wouldn’t know how else to deal with this. Thank you for all the effort you put into helping women find a cure.</p><strong>Anonymous</strong>

The Vaginismus Private Forum is reserved for those who are going through our program and have received our books (passes are not included when only a dilator set is ordered).

           <p>Our forum pass enables you to create a private and anonymous password and username. Once you have your username and password, you are able to receive entrance into the Vaginismus Private Forum, gaining access to the support of hundreds of women worldwide.</p>
           <p>NOTE: If you have previously ordered these products and do not have a pass, please <strong><a href="/contact-us/index.html">contact us</a></strong> to obtain one (at no cost).</p>

          <h2>Are Spouses Allowed?</h2>
          <p>Yes, spouses are allowed. It is often helpful for spouses to educate themselves about vaginismus and to have a place where they can ask questions and find support if desired. We have created an area in the forum reserved for spouses and partners.</p>
          <p>NOTE: Spouses will need their own separate email address to create a username (two usernames cannot share the same address). Also, spouses should note that they need to follow forum guidelines for acceptable posts.</p>
