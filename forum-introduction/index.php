          <p>The forum also has a chat room for women to connect on a more personal level. Women from around the world with vaginismus can chat about their lives or ask questions about treatment. We find that even in anonymity, as women begin to open up about their problem, they become more positive about the condition of vaginismus because they no longer feel as isolated.</p>

The Vaginismus Private Forum is reserved for those who are going through our program and have received our books (passes are not included when only a dilator set is ordered).

          <h2>Are Spouses Allowed?</h2>
          <p>Yes, spouses are allowed. It is often helpful for spouses to educate themselves about vaginismus and to have a place where they can ask questions and find support if desired. We have created an area in the forum reserved for spouses and partners.</p>
          <p>NOTE: Spouses will need their own separate email address to create a username (two usernames cannot share the same address). Also, spouses should note that they need to follow forum guidelines for acceptable posts.</p>
