              <h2>The Best Information</h2>
              <p>I am really grateful that you created this website. Your website provides the best information about this condition. I finally found out last year that I have vaginismus. I did not know what was wrong with me and when I finally decided to go see a doctor, the first one absolutely had no idea. The second one diagnosed me with this condition. Unfortunately, soon after I lost my job and stopped treatment. I tried to start again but felt like I had to start all over again. I decided to do more research and came across your site. You have explained the condition in the best possible way and I understand what I am going through. I really hope that I can get past my fear and hope your book will help me through it. Thank you.</p>

              <h2>Fabulous Site</h2>
              <p>Congratulations on such a fabulous site and thank you for sharing this problem with people so sufferers do not feel so alone.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

              <h2>Constructive Criticism</h2>
              <p>I am writing to thank you for your excellent kit and also offer a constructive criticism of the website.</p>

              <p>I overcame vaginismus in about 6 weeks using your kit, and am very thankful for this. I also found the forum extremely helpful, and still use it from time to time.
              </p>

              <p>I have recommended your website to my GP and today to a top fertility consultant, who was very interested to hear of it and the success I have had with it.</p>

              <p>I knew about your website for a long time before ordering the kit. The reason I didn't order it earlier is that the website gives the impression of a glossy advertising website which is selling something. I assumed that if you are putting that much effort into selling it with all the photos of models then it must be a product that doesn't work.</p>

              <p>There is no need for all these pictures of perfect people, as if you are trying to promote a product. You are offering a very effective solution to a problem. No one would buy the kit unless they needed it, but it a shame to put people off buying it because it looks so over-promoted and advertised that it must be a gimmick.
              </p>

              <p>I am British so perhaps the website does not give that impression to Americans, but from reading the forums I know I am not the only one who knew about the website for a long time before ordering from it.</p>

              <p>The new testimonies and information on what the treatment involves go a long way towards giving the impression that this is actually a kit for real people with a real problem rather than a gimmick for supermodels, but I still think there is no need
                for all the glossy photos.</p>

              <p>Once I got into the forums and saw that here were real people struggling as I was I had a completely different view of the website than I got from the glossy photos and advertising speak of the main pages.</p>

              <p>Thanks again for a very valuable kit. I hope the front pages of the website don't put anyone else off buying it who needs it.</p>

              <h2>There is so much information available</h2>
              <p>Thank you so much for the response. I am feeling much better about the situation. I was starting to think something was wrong with me because I have a couple of friends that are also virgins and didn't experience the type of pain that I did. I've been looking over the site, and I am relieved to know that there's so much information available. I can't thank you all enough for the work you all do with the site, it means a lot!</p>

              <p>Thank you so much for such a wonderful website. It really was a blessing to find. I am so happy that I am not the only one with this issue.</p>

              <h2>Most informative</h2>
              <p>I was referred to this site by pelvic floor physical therapists for some internal vaginal muscle triggers after hysterectomy. I wanted to contact you and tell you that your information on your symptoms and causes tabs is the most informative I've
                been able to find about the pain cycle.</p>

              <h2>Much relief</h2>
              <p>Thank you for your reply which has helped a lot. I also phoned one of the therapists who gave you feedback on the website who has confirmed what you have said. We have been told in the past by a relationship counsellor that they had never heard of
                this issue before (this was before we knew of the word 'vaginismus') and I'm sure you can imagine the relief many years later when we stumbled a few weeks ago onto your website. Having this situation normalised is already starting to reduce the
                fear of it not ever getting better.</p>

              <h2>Thrilled there is hope</h2>
              <p>I have not yet ordered the kit, but am so excited to do so. After 11 years of a happy but unconsummated marriage, I am thrilled that there is hope. When we were first married, the doctors who examined me had little to no knowledge on vaginismus. I
                actually had an operation a few months into our marriage that broke the hymen and was supposed to enlarge the area. Yet, still no penetration. I was then told that I was physically perfectly fine and that it was something in my head that I would
                have to overcome. Looking forward to my husband coming home tonight so we can order this together. Thank you for the site....I am optimistic that you will soon receive a testimonial from me.</p>

              <h2>Happiest woman alive</h2>
              <p>I would like to thank you for saving my marriage. Me and my husband have been trying to have sex for years and we would end up more and more frustrated every single time we would try. After a while we got sick of trying and trying because we would
                get no where!! We ended up to stop trying. We would just avoid that subject because we wouldn't want to go through the disappointment again. I would cry and cry by myself cause I thought there was something wrong with me. I was scared my husband
                would cheat on me or leave me. I was devastated because he is the love of my life, he is my high school sweetheart. One day my husband comes home with a whole bunch of photo copies of your site on the internet. I started reading about vaginismus
                and stories of peoples lives that was my life. I was reading my life over and over again!!! I couldn't stop crying of joy that I wasn't the only one. That there was nothing wrong with me!!! I ordered the kit and I did exactly what it told me to
                do. 2 months later I was having sex with my husband and we were the happiest couple ever!!!! Thank you so much because right now I am 3 months pregnant with twins and I am the happiest woman alive cause this is what I have been waiting for my whole
                life, to become a mother. My dream has finally come true and we couldn't do it without the help of the vaginismus site and the vaginismus kit!!!!!!! Thank you again and again!!!!

              <h2>Help and kindness</h2>
              <p>Oh my goodness, thank you so much. I was just diagnosed with this condition a few days ago, so I am new to the entire aspect. I appreciate all of the support that I have gotten from this website so far, and look forward to being a part of the community.
                The help and kindness I have gotten from the respondents of my message, and the overall quality of the website has been a great network of support and security. Thank you again.</p>

              <h2>Thank God for your website</h2>
              <p>Omg, omg, omg, thank you, thank you, thank you. I am 21 years old and have been married for one year and two months and have never had penetration . . . Neither was i able to use a tampon on anything. Just last week my husband and I were talking about
                separating because he got fustrated and is in the military and away right now so he is extra fustrated and all and just last night I decided to give researching one last try. I was told I have genophobia (fear of sex), I was told I just need to
                relax, to give it time, maybe I'm not ready - practically every excuse in the book. Thank God for your website. My husband is due home in 22 days and I am hoping I can give him a surprise and I will be ready. At one point I stopped believing in
                God because I kept telling myself kids at age 13 and 14 are having sex and they don't even care and I wanna do it - married and extremely in love and unable to do it. I started saying He didn't care and He didn't exist and just last week I said
                I'm gonna try believing again and start going to church and viola I came across your site. You are a life saver. I had an appointment for tomorrow to see a gyno to get my vagina stretched while I'm asleep and I've learned from reading your site
                that it won't help because when I'm awake I might still be afraid of penetration even though i was stretched. I also just ordered the complete kit and I will definately keep you posted on what happens and my progress. Thank you guys so much. God
                bless and hopefully I get my package by Wednesday.</p>

              <h2>Info from website was helpful</h2>
              <p>The most important thing for me is that I got rid of the disease which had been caused rather with stress and fear, and lack of information then with physiology. In this case, the information from the website, the stories of women, and the hope to
                be cured were the best therapy. I am really thankful also for your time and efforts.

              <h2>Encouraging</h2>
              <p>Many thanks for your quick response. I found the piece on the website both encouraging and helpful regarding treatment for vaginismus when you are single. A lot of the fears I have about meeting someone new, are echoed in the text. It is a relief
                to find that others feel the same way and there is hope, as it can be quite isolating !!

              <p>Dear Vaginismus.com founders and members, I received my kit today and look forward with hope, prayers and support from this wonderful forum that I will soon overcome vaginismus. Discovering this site, learning about the kit and reading through postings
                in this forum - has been a Godsend. I have the most amazing and supportive husband in the world and feel truly blessed. But despite his love and support and patience, I felt very sad and alone with this problem. You can imagine our joy when I discovered
                there was a name for what I am experiencing, and to find that there are others who are going through the same thing was more comforting than I can ever express...I finally saw hope...I finally felt help could be on its way...and I am not some sort
                of freak of nature. My prayers are with you all...and THANK YOU...finding this means more to me than I could ever express.

              <h2>Nothing helped us as much as this website</h2>
              <p>I cannot begin to describe the change in our life after I came across this website. My husband and i are both indians and were both virgins when we got married. We were unable to consummate our marriage, my husband developed a form of erectile dysfunction
                due to this. Our problems culminated almost in us divorcing. We finally rallied together and that is when I came across this website. I immediately ordered the dilator set and started working with it. We have been married for 3-1/2 years and seeing
                a sex therapist for 1-1/2 years during that time.</p>

              <p>I am ecstatic to say that within 2 weeks of purchasing the dilator set, recently we were able to have intercourse. Nothing else helped us as much as this website has. Not even the therapist.</p>

              <p>Just reading the feedback from all the others and realising that we weren't the only ones suffering made a tremendous change. So if I can convey the same message to yet another person stumbling upon this website, I would be really happy. It is never
                too late to work on our problems and take control of it. The tools that this website offers make it all the more easy to do so.</p>

                In the world there are only few people who have such big heart and share their stories with others. But, there are some few people (as you, Kate) who really help us who have this problem! Thank you! I think that who seeding goodness will reap happiness.
                I study medicine and I must admit, that your website have far the most information about vaginismus! Even in medical book is this subject very poorly covered. I ... owe you a great debt of thanks for all!</p>

              <h2>This website is fantastic</h2>
              <p>I would just like to say that this web site is fantastic. I am now 25 but when I was 18 with my first sexual partner I suffered terribly. I felt as though someone was putting a knife inside me and would cry every time we tried. I couldn't tell any
                of my friends cause it was so weird. My mother and partner at the time were fantastic. I visited many docters and had many tests which were horrible experiences for a 18 year old. I was also told things like don't use condoms which terrified me,
                and try different positions which was extremely embarrasing.</p>

              <p>In 2 years I had 3 speres, many internal investigations, a urine test and scan cause they thought my bladder wasn't emptying and many more. At the end of the 2 years I had key hole surgery so they could see if there was any physical problems. They
                put a camera in my tummy button and a probe in the cut on my pubic hair line. They couldn't find anything wrong and it was very painful. The last thing I was told was I probably was a psychological problem but I was given no help and no support.
                I was now 20 and had broken up with my first love after 2 years of being prodded and poked with no result&hellip;</p>

              <p>My friend saw the interview on this morning and said to look at the web site. I can't describe enough how much this has helped me mentally. I didn't know anyone else had suffered and had kept in hidden for so many years like I was a freak or something.
                Thank you so much...</p>

              <p>The interview was on an english tv morning programme. It's called 'This Morning'. The interview was about a girl who had gone through all the symptoms and after 3 years was finally diagnosed. I got your web address through a link on theirs which is

              <h2>The website and program have definitely helped</h2>
              <p>&hellip; we have started practicing the real act. It has taken me a long time get started due to lack of time for practice, and my case wasn't that bad to begin with. The program has definitely helped a lot. I wouldn't know how else to deal with this.
                Thank you for all the efforts you have put in to this in order to cure it. I especially would like to thank you for your website. There are a lot of people out there, who don't know what this is called &hellip; Thanks again.</p>

              <h2>What a well put together site</h2>
              <p>&hellip; We just found your site and what a well put together site it is, it was such a relief to read all that and to be able to understand better what we have been going through. We have been married 13 years and for all that time have never been
                able to have intercourse. I have only finally just last year been able to insert a tampon and that was an amazing feat. It has been an incredibly hard time as you do feel isolated and even a bit "weird" that you can't do something that seems so
                natural for many others. For a long time I didn't even know what on earth was wrong with me, and it is a fearful awful time. I am so blessed to have a very faithful, understanding, loving husband who has been with me every step of the way &hellip;
                Thank you for your site as it does show that there are others, who are suffering in this way and it helps you to understand that you are not alone and that it isn't your fault. The guilt that you can suffer from is overwhelming at times and there
                are times I even have wanted to end it all. Thank goodness I do have a supportive husband and I also thank God that I do have a strong faith in him &hellip; Again thank you - your site probably helps so many people feel that they really are not
                alone. It is an extremely hard thing to talk about and not something you can just share with anyone. For years people have pestered me about why don't we have kids - I am now 33 &hellip; It really is like a silent problem. Thanks from NZ</p>

              <h2>Ever so glad I found your website</h2>
              <p>&hellip; I should say the pack I bought was very helpful and I was ever so glad that I found your website. I never knew that I had vaginismus and even when I got married, my husband could not penetrate me and I felt really upset that on our honeymoon
                we could not make love, in fact it was not our honeymoon but a holiday. When I came back to England I went to see the doctor and she told me to use lubricating gel and more foreplay, I did also told my doctor when I was at university and she said
                the same thing. I thought maybe my husband is not pushy enough and if I have a smear test it might help to open the vagina, it was the most agonizing moment in my life, it took 3 times the average time to collect the cells. The nurse did not notice
                anything and she told me 'wait until you have children you could park a bus there'. I thought that was not funny because I could not even get my finger there.</p>

              <p>After 2 years of marriage I thought that I will have to get to the bottom of it, I have knock so many doors with no answers and I have not consummate the wedding, my first point was the doctor again and she told me that there is nothing on the NHS
                that could help me. I would have to go private and I knew I could not afford it. The next step was research. I spent days on the internet trying to understand my condition and looking a name for it. I started with little words like 'dysfunction'
                and finally the word came up. I did more research on the treatment and vaginismus.com was the one that was most appropriate and most promising. I also thought the price was reasonable. I also talked to the family planning nurse and she mentioned
                should would refer me to a psychosexual therapist, I started the treatment together with the kit from vaginismus.com. Whatever the therapist was telling me it is fully detailed in the book and guidance, and the diary keeping was wonderful in this
                moment of change it is very important that you talk about your feeling, for me having the therapy together with the book from vaginismus.com reduced my treatment period to the minimum, it took me only 5 months to reach the biggest size. I would
                recommend the product to anybody and I am ever so grateful to vaginismus.com to make me feel like a women and to be able to enjoy sex. My level of depression dropped very low and I enjoy living a little bit more.</p>

              <p>However, one advice, it is vital that your partner understand the process you are going through and it will be teamwork. I found the video very educational for him and he completely understood his role in the process. He was patient and did whatever
                was told from the book and the therapist. He even read the book to understand the condition. Whenever I moved to the next size we have always celebrated it, it was like going through the education system again. Thank you very much vaginismus.com
                - from another pleased customer.</p>

              <h2>Your website and products are invaluable resources</h2>
              <p>I just want to tell how helpful your vaginismus kit (book, workbook, and dilator set) has been in my treatment of this condition. One night, after another failed attempt to have intercourse with my husband, I decided to surf the Internet in search
                of any information that might shed some light on my "problem." I stumbled upon your website and starting reading the description of vaginismus and women's accounts of dealing with it. It was like reading my own autobiography! I can't explain the
                joy and relief I felt knowing that what I'm dealing with has a name and thousands of other women like me suffer from it. I ordered the kit that very night and was able to approach my OB/GYN with information that led to a definitive diagnosis of
                vaginismus. Now that I know what my 'problem' is, I can face it and work on overcoming it. I've read your book cover to cover and am practicing with the dilators. My progress has been slow, but I'm confident with time and determination I'll be able
                to have a normal, healthy sex life with my husband.</p>

              <p>Thank you again. Your website and products are invaluable resources to women like me all over the world. If I had not found your website that night, no doubt I'd still be in the dark about my condition and feeling hopeless about my sexual relationship
                with my husband. Keep up the great work!</p>
