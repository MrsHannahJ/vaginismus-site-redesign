    <h2>Treatment Overview</h2>
    <h4>Successful vaginismus treatment does not require drugs, surgery, hypnosis, nor any other complex invasive technique.</h4>
    <div class="large-6">
      <p>Treatment steps can usually be completed at home using a self-help approach, allowing a woman to work at her own pace in privacy, or in cooperation with her health care provider or specialist.</p>
      <p>Vaginismus is fully treatable.  Women experiencing sexual tightness/pain, penetration problems, or unconsummated relationships can expect remarkable resolution of their vaginismus, allowing full, pain-free intercourse.</p>
