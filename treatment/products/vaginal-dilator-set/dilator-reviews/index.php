              <h2>Curable</h2>
              <p>This is a curable condition. After menopause I experienced vaginismus. It went undiagnosed and not understood by three different doctors. Finally I was diagnosed and sent for pelvic floor physiotherapy. The physiotherapist recommended I buy the vaginismus product and after having this condition for about six years, within six weeks I was over it and am able to lead a normal love life. I want other women to know this condition is curable even if you've had it for a long time.</p>

              <h2>Finally understood the problem </h2>
              <p> Thank you so much. I had repeatedly been to the gynecologist without any true help. My husband and I felt so lost, and when we found your website it was like someone finally understood the problem. The dilators were a god-sent! After a few months
                of going through each size of dilators we were finally ready to put all of the frustration behind us, and truly attempt to have sexual intercourse. We successfully consummated our marriage after a year of failed attempts, and are now having the
                sex life we had once only dreamed of. Thank you so much!</p>

              <h2>Best relations with my husband since 2008</h2>
              <p> I never would have thought I of all people would tell my story on here. But, after cancer of uterus and total hysterectomy... I found myself in the position of VERY painful sex with my husband. It just kept getting worse. I was not diagnosed, however
                my doctor seemed to give enough info for me to research my symptoms. So I set out on the research of this "issue" myself. Thank you so much for this product. I found after using the dilators for only 5 days... I had the best relations with my husband
                since 2008!!! and It was TOTALLY pain free! Oh thank you!! This web site will be given to a few friends who have told me they have issues as well. I feel like I have my life back now. :)</p>

              <h2>So Grateful</h2>
              <p>I am a 55 year old single woman. I am so grateful that I found this website and product. I wish that I had known about this common problem. I really thought that sex was never going to be a part of my life again after menopause. It would be nice if
                we could educate more women, but it seems that male sexual problems (how many Viagra commercials do we have to see?) are more talked about than women's. I will recommend this product to other women that I know but it would have been great if my
                gynecologist had informed me 3 years ago when I was going through menopause that <em>vaginal atrophy</em> could happen to me (especially since I never had a natural childbirth (2 c-sections), was a smoker and did not have a partner during menopause).
                I did so much research on my own to try and figure out what was going on after he (my gynecologist) prescribed Estring and it just wasn't enough. Ironically, after a few unreturned phone calls to his office, I went online and found this site, his
                office finally called back and recommended vaginal dilators right after I had ordered them . . thanks again.</p>

              <p>Don't know if you remember of me, asking about my order something like a month ago. Well, the thing is, I just want to give you people a feedback about the dilator set. My girlfriend started using it on january 13th, regarding the treatment of vaginismus.
                Well, last night, that is, 4 weeks after starting the treatment, and after some foreplay with dilators number 3, 4 and 5, we achieved our first penetration. It was unbelievable. And today we did it again, without using the dilators to start. So,
                what we I'm trying to say is that we are another couple of people that are very satisfied with your product. Keep doing the good job. Thanks</p>

              <h2>Extremely Satisfied</h2>
              <p>After reading about and realizing I had vaginismus, and after many many failed attempts, I'd almost given up on having a "normal" sex life. Until I came across your Dilator Set, that is. It arrived barely a week after I ordered it (I live in Mumbai,
                India so this was a very pleasant surprise). After a week of practicing, I was able to insert the 4th and 5th dilators - which really helped convince me that I'd be able to do something I'd earlier thought was impossible. A few days later, I had
                sex for the first time, and a few days after that I was totally pain-free, incredibly happy and well, extremely satisfied!:) Thank you for a great product and excellent customer service.</p>

              <p>I just wanted to thank you so much for the quality product that you have provided. My husband and I waited to have sex until our wedding night and after multiple tries at intercourse, I just couldn't get past the severe pain. Something felt seriously
                wrong, we did some research on the web and stumbled upon your site. Upon returning from our honeymoon we ordered the dilator set. After using the set for less than a week, I saw incredible progress and last night we were able to consummate our marriage.
                I was amazed at how fast it worked for me. What an incredible gift, can't thank you enough!</p>

                I was able to comfortably have intercourse with my husband, and for the first time in two years it was pleasurable! Again, thank you is the least I could say for helping me with a very frustrating problem that affects numerous women.</p>

              <p>I am a Physical Therapist at William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan. My specialty area is treatment of pelvic floor muscle dysfunction. Do you suggest an introductory packet that I can purchase to show to my patients? Currently, one of my
                patients brought your dilators to me and I am helping her to use them. They were given to her by her physician at the University of Michigan. I am especially impressed with them because of the handle. It makes it very easy to treat deeper trigger
                point areas which are hard to reach. Great product.</p>
              <p>...You are welcome to post my message on your website. There are a group of us at Beaumont who treat Pelvic Floor dysfunction. It's always good for us to expand our knowledge to help our patients find good products.</p>

              <p>As a psychotherapist who works with vaginismus patients, I am very satisfied with your product. After every psychotherapy session, I have been asking women to try dilators either in clinic or at home as a homework. Results are great, very impressive!
                So far, all women have managed to cope with reflexive contractions of PC muscles by means of using them. Many thanks.</p>

              <p>I'm a physical therapist at a fitness center owned by Northwest Community Hospital in Arlington Heights, IL. During one of my clinicals while a student at Northwestern, my "pelvic floor" clinical instructor always recommended your website and dilator
                sets to patients. Now that I've graduated, a few other therapists and myself are in the process of developing a pelvic floor program at my current clinic. I was wondering if you are able to provide a dilator set to health professionals to show and
                instruct with patients prior to them purchasing their own? Please let me know. I appreciate it.</p>

              <h2>This kit helped me remove my fear</h2>
              <p>I thank you. Last night I finally successfully had sex with my boyfriend. I bought this dilator set in January 2007. I've been "practicing" for 8 months and it worked! I was unable to be penetrated at all before. So I browsed online to see if there's
                a solution to this. I found this website and the dilation kit seems to be a sensible solution. I started with the smallest of course. It hurt a bit at first, but then I gradually became more comfortable with it. So I moved on to the second, and
                finally the third. This kit helped me remove my fear of penetration and also relax my vaginal muscles, so it's both physical and psychological help. Thank you so much.</p>

              <p>I was suffering from vaginismus for three years and was very depressed. Then while browsing through net I found your website, and I ordered for the dilator set immediately. With the help of dilators I overcame the fear of insertion. I used the dilator
                set slow and steady for 5 months, and one fine day without much difficulty I was able to have sex with my husband. The initial discomfort (not pain) of having intercourse will be there even after using dilators but the fact that I was able to insert
                the fourth dilator gave me confidence and above all hope that I can have sex like other women.</p>

                me that there is lot of improvement and if I am able to insert the dilator, I am ready for painless intercourse. She gave me advice on positions, and now I am successfully able to allow my husband to penetrate me. We both were very happy and are
                now hopeful of having a better sex life . Thanks a lot to vaginismus.com for the dilators which helped me overcome this problem.</p>

                addressed the problem and shed light on the subject in a kind, calm way. After reading your book I ordered the dilators, and am AMAZED to tell you that I've made incredible progress in just a few months - and to think all I needed was some education

              <h2>Botox and Vaginismus</h2>
              <p>When we use Botox to overcome the vaginal spasm that occurs in vaginismus, our goal is for the woman to be able to have pain free intercourse. There is a high rate of success when Botox is used for vaginismus. Nevertheless this is not the entire answer,
                in that women who have never had intercourse are not necessarily fulfilled. Women need to understand their own bodies and what turns them on and also what does not. There is a learning process that is needed for both members of the couple.</p>

              <p>These concepts are brought to light by the excellent book written by Mark and Lisa Carter entitiled "Completely Overcome Vaginismus". In this book the authors take the patient through the many considerations leading up to possible causes of vaginismus,
                and a step by step approach to overcome vaginismus using a series of graduated dilators, and the use of dilators prior to intercourse. Additional exercises are discussed to allow the woman to develop a greater awareness of their own sexual desires.
                For the patient who wants to move more quickly through the process, botox is useful in its ability to block vaginal spasm. When Botox is used in conjunction with the recommendations in this text, patients have one more modality towards the successful
                outcome that they desire.</p>

              <p>This book as well as the dilators can be ordered from www.vaginismus.com. In our own practice this book has become a "must read" and our patients are encouraged to use the dilators after the botox begins to take effect. Generally botox is effective
                in about 5 to 7 days, but the process to achieve intercourse takes longer, generally about 3 to 4 weeks. We recommend that our patients move slowly through the process. Botox begins to wear off at about 2 1/2 to 4 months, so it is best to complete
                the process during that time frame. Once pain free intercourse is achieved, the vagina will remain dilated and usually repeat botox is not needed. At times a repeat dose is given if the patient needs a higher dose of Botox or if continued difficulties
                are encountered.</p>

              <p>I ordered the dilator set because I had been with my boyfriend for almost 3 years and we had not yet had intercourse. I wanted to give myself to him so badly, yet everytime we tried it felt like I was just... stuck closed. I could get tampons in,
                but only with a lot of effort after calming myself down. I was so scared of pain that I clamped up.</p>

              <p>I received my dilator set in mid October. I've been using them progressively. It didn't take me very long to get to the fourth and I have now been able to have sex with my boyfriend.</p>

              <p>I was so happy. The happiest I have been in a long time. I felt like so much stress was lifted off of my shoulders. I feel proud that I overcame my fears and I'm so thankful that this site exists. I was able to order the dilators confidentially and
                the delivery was quick and speedy.</p>

              <p>I really am so happy. I can't even believe how quickly I got through the 4 dilators. I was so scared it would take me long. But it took me less that a month. Thank you so much! Without this site I would have stayed stressed and sad all the time. I
                felt so ashamed and terrible about it. I wanted to please my boyfriend and show my love for him.</p>

              <p>And now I can. :) <br /> It was worth it. It really was.<br /> I'm proud of myself for taking the initiative.<br />

                with your product. I would like to be able to offer my PT's as many types/styles of dilator as are available, &#038; have already given many written information on your product. Many patients like the idea of the handle, whereas most other dilators
                do not have this feature. Thank You.</p>

              <p>Hello there! I am a physical therapist in California returning to work after being off for 2 years with children. I specialize in treatment of pelvic floor dysfunction and get at least one referral each month for vaginismus. I was looking online for
                the previous brand of dilators I used to recommend and found your website - yours look much more user friendly and comfortable! &hellip; I have a patient right now who could benefit, so I am excited to share the info. with her. I would be happy
                to provide you with some feedback from my clinical experiences. I think it is wonderful that you offer such a comprehensive set of supplies, in particular for those who may not have access to a doctor or physical therapist who can help them! I'll

              <h2>You have made my life much more pleasant</h2>
              <p>I am a retired Academic Orthopedic Surgeon. I have found two non-vaginal uses for your vaginal dilators:<br /> 1. Treatment of internal and external hemorrhoids with excellent results in a short period of time when all else had failed. Continued use
                advisable.<br /> 2. 14 years post successful Radical Prostatectomy for cancer, I had very annoying nocturnal urinary frequency, interrupting normal sleep. Use of your second largest dilator to gently massage the scarred prostatic bed has completely
                relieved this very troublesome problem.<br /> As a physician I wanted to pass on this information to you. Thank you and God Bless you and your work! Many thanks. You have made my life much more pleasant.</p>

              <p>Hi, while giving birth to my son I got a 2nd degree tear on my perineum &hellip; went for physical therapy to learn to control my lower pelvic muscles because they were spasming during pelvic exams and we couldn't have intercourse - too painful.

              <h2>NYC Physical therapists</h2>
              <p>As physical therapists, we use the vaginal dilators to assist in lightly stretching the pelvic floor muscles as well as for the patients to continue their own myofascial/trigger point release at home. Patients see us between 1-3 times/week, but we
                recommend that they do their own muscle re-education at home with the dilators to maintain what we have accomplished during the PT session. Patients are very happy with the results and by giving them the dilators they feel that they are taking an
                active role in their treatment/recovery. Thank you for your help with these patients. </p>

                right now. I like that your dilators are tapered at the end for greater ease of insertion. I think I may prefer the size also after holding the two products side by side. I will be taking them to a talk I am giving to a support group as well. I
                like your website and continue to refer people to both the website and your products. I&#8217;ve gotten a lot of positive feedback from my patients in response.</p>
