            <h2>Vaginal Dilator Set</h2>
            <p>This medical-grade vaginal dilator set is perfect for treating vaginismus and other similar conditions. Each set includes 6 multi-sized graduated dilators, a universal handle, lubricant, and care instructions all within a soft unbleached muslin pouch. The dilators are carefully crafted with a comfortable size range, a seamless finish, and a silky low-friction texture to allow smooth entry and eliminate sticking.</p>
            <p>Convenient handle improves insertion control while keeping lubricant off one’s hands. The product is medically safe for individual use (see your doctor for more information) and easy to clean with soapy water. For storage portability and privacy, dilators fit one inside another forming a convenient, small package.</p>
            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Our new, smallest dilator is narrower than a tampon. This size is particularly suited for women who have difficulty with tampon insertion and also helps to assist with a smooth transition to larger sizes.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>6 gradual sizes plus an ergonomic solid-lock handle</li>
