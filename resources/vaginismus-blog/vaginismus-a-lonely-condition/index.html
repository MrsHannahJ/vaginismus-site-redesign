The stigma behind any sexual disorder is crushing but vaginismus is so misunderstood that women often feel like they are the only one who suffers this way. Fear of embarrassment keeps vaginismus locked in silence as women are often ashamed to tell anyone including relatives, best friends or even their doctor. Who would ever understand her when she says, &#8220;I can&#8217;t have sex?&#8221;</p><p>Vaginismus.com offers a free, private forum which is a safe place for women with vaginismus to ask questions of professional moderators while meeting women from all over the world who understand their condition. When women first come to our forum they respond much like this:</p><ul><li>I&#8217;m skeptical. Will this program really work?</li><li>I&#8217;m really nervous about this.</li><li>It seems like I&#8217;m the only woman in the world with this problem.</li><li>Please help me! I need hope.</li><li>I&#8217;m scared, excited, worried, hopeful. I don&#8217;t know how to feel!</li><li>I&#8217;m desperately in need of guidance.</li></ul><p>After they look through some of the posts in the forum their responses become more positive:</p><ul><li>It is very comforting to know other women feel the same way I do.</li><li>I can&#8217;t believe someone else actually understands! I&#8217;m finally not alone.</li><li>Reading about the success of other women gives me so much hope.</li><li>I suffered in silence for too long. I wish I would have known about this sooner.</li><li>I felt like I was in a foreign land and now I finally found people who speak my language.</li><li>I&#8217;m so encouraged by what I&#8217;ve read here.</li><li>Thank you so much for offering this support.</li></ul><p>Although this is a self-help program, there is no need to go through treatment alone. Women from all over the world are willing to help educate and encourage you while providing much needed motivation for your journey. These women are at all stages of vaginismus treatment from those just joining the program to those who have already overcome this condition and now enjoy pain-free intercourse and lead exciting sex lives.</p><p>Within the Vaginismus.com forum it is &#8216;normal&#8217; to have vaginismus. Can you imagine such a place? It does exist. As a moderator in the forum, I have been privileged to hear many stories of women as they start out very skeptical and then progress through the treatment until finally overcoming the foe of vaginismus. Women talk about their fears, hopes, pain, joys and triumphs as other women share with them and celebrate the victories great and small.</p><p>The forum is a unique place of hope and comfort designed to help women who need healing in a unique way. Hundreds of women have already found help through this free and informative service. We hope you will join us.</p><p>We wish you all the best, Kate Cardwell<br /> Vaginismus.com Forum Moderator</p> <span class="et_social_bottom_trigger"></span></div><div class="et_post_meta_wrapper"><section id="comment-wrap"><h1 id="comments" class="page_title">89 Comments</h1><ol class="commentlist clearfix"><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-333"> <article id="comment-333" class="comment-body clearfix"><div class="comment_avatar"></div><div class="comment_postinfo"> <span class="fn">nina</span> <span class="comment_date"> on March 27, 2015 at 12:46 am </span></div><div class="comment_area"><div class="comment-content clearfix"><p>I&#8217;m 38 and dismayed, as i have never used a tampon, an extreme fear of putting anything in me. Think it will be painful, not open eg blocked shut, and won&#8217;t work. I forced myself to try after many goes at 24 but it was painful and i fainted. That was only penetration, and my only ever time. I have a learning disorder si wondered if it was that, or perhaps because i was brought up in a strict religious gone, or because I read when i was 14 that sex hurts and that possibly put fear into my psyche. Whatever it is i sense that other normal grown women would be shocked, even teenagers would say in not much of an adult. I want to be able to consummate my marriage to a sexy fiance in two years time. I feel ashamed that I&#8217;ve never used a tampon and will be 40.</p></div></div> </article></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-332"> <article id="comment-332" class="comment-body clearfix"><div class="comment_avatar"></div><div class="comment_postinfo"> <span class="fn">D88girl</span> <span class="comment_date"> on February 24, 2015 at 9:54 pm </span></div><div class="comment_area"><div class="comment-content clearfix"><p>I am 26 years old and never had penetration from obgyn, tampons or sex.

I have never been able to insert a tampon up me and even any attempt at penetration/intercourse has failed. It is soul destroying. I badly need help, and I dont want to live the rest of my life as a loner who shys away from men because of my anxieties about penetration. I have come across this website in the hope that I can start from here and be cured from this condition in order to be able to have sex and in the future have children. But right now I have no partner and never allowed myself to have one because I feel ashamed and embarrassed. I feel my vaginismus is both psychological and physical. I am gutted for anyone who goes through this, it really is tough. I dont feel comfortable saying it to my GP either. I feel it is not a common enough problem in Ireland. I need help&#8230;</p></div></div> </article></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-330"> <article id="comment-330" class="comment-body clearfix"><div class="comment_avatar"></div><div class="comment_postinfo"> <span class="fn">Emmy</span> <span class="comment_date"> on September 25, 2014 at 9:31 am </span></div><div class="comment_area"><div class="comment-content clearfix"><p>I found this site over a year ago and it has already helped me so much. The kit is excellent and knowing that other ladies are going through a similar experience really helps on an emotional and psychological level. When I first received the kit, the thought of using the dilators filled me with dread &#8212; I honestly couldn&#8217;t see how I would use the first one, let alone get to the fifth. I was so scared and my anxiety was sky high. I put it off for months before plucking up the courage to try. A year on, I have progressed through the whole kit and last week was able to have a smear test for the very first time &#8212; the test was not painful and I am just so happy I have been able to reach this personal milestone. I truly know how difficult it is and can really relate to everyone&#8217;s stories. The key is to hang in there and practice, practice, practice. You are not alone and you will get through this!</p></div></div> </article></li><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-329"> <article id="comment-329" class="comment-body clearfix"><div class="comment_avatar"></div><div class="comment_postinfo"> <span class="fn">Diane</span> <span class="comment_date"> on September 20, 2014 at 2:45 pm </span></div><div class="comment_area"><div class="comment-content clearfix"><p>I have just found his site and it has helped me pschologically already and I am sure there is hope out there!</p><p>Diane</p></div></div> </article></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-328"> <article id="comment-328" class="comment-body clearfix"><div class="comment_avatar"></div><div class="comment_postinfo"> <span class="fn">Sarah</span> <span class="comment_date"> on August 6, 2014 at 5:13 am </span></div><div class="comment_area"><div class="comment-content clearfix"><p>I am reading though this and am relating to so many comments.  I have been with my now husband for 10 years and never penetration.  I am a 34 year old married virgin.  I have an amazing patient husband however it does greatly upset him.  I really feel if I could just have sex our relationship would be complete, we would love to start a family and are the last of all our friends and family to do so, I have never spoken to a doctor that understands, they all say you are fine, just have a glass of wine etc and relax.  How can you relax when you are so anxious it makes you sick and you feel like a failure.  I have hope and can&#8217;t wait for the day when I can say I am not a virgin. I wish everyone with vagimus all the best and with support I hope we can all get through this.  I have recently come close (he had 2 fingers in me!!) but as soon as it has been a few days I am back to square one.  We both work long hours and find it hard to find the quality time together.  I find the pressure eases when I am on this site.  We are not alone, and we will get through this.

I&#8217;m 45 years old.  I married for the first time a year and a half ago and always knew that I would reserve sex for the marriage relationship, but now my husband and I have never been able to consummate.  I&#8217;ve never been able to insert anything actually(tampon, endure a pelvic exam, etc.) I thought that when I married, sex would be a different matter because my level of desire has always been quite high, but it isn&#8217;t different.  It&#8217;s like there&#8217;s a wall and it&#8217;s hard to imagine that changing. I know some of it probably stems from a molestation event as a child, and also from medical issues as a child that required painful procedures. Who knew those things could reach out and haunt my marriage so many years later? It&#8217;s hard for me not to be skeptical at my age when so much time has passed and things seem to be hormonally and physically &#8220;drying up&#8221; as well.  I&#8217;m fortunate to have married a patient and loving husband who&#8217;s always quick to remind me that our marriage isn&#8217;t based on sex and that even if we couldn&#8217;t do anything, he&#8217;d marry me all over again&#8230; and that because we engage in other intimate behaviors, he doesn&#8217;t think of our relationship as &#8220;sexless.&#8221;  Still, it&#8217;s hard to even feel like a real wife, watch my desire plummet as this continues, and feel like we&#8217;re just sort of pretend married.  It&#8217;s not reasonable, I know, but so it feels.  I&#8217;ve just ordered the book (homework from my PT).  Between that, reading some of other people&#8217;s accounts here, and my husband finally going to a PT appt with me (which I&#8217;d avoided his doing until now), I&#8217;m hopeful&#8230; a little skeptical, but desperate and hopeful.</p></div></div> </article></li><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-321"> <article id="comment-321" class="comment-body clearfix"><div class="comment_avatar"></div><div class="comment_postinfo"> <span class="fn">finally</span> <span class="comment_date"> on November 15, 2012 at 10:13 pm </span></div><div class="comment_area"><div class="comment-content clearfix"><p>Finally, after suffering from vaginismus for so long and for some time not even knowing what was wrong with me, I finally found something that is working for me and is correcting my problem.

We have two little boys, one who will be 3 yrs old soon and one who is now 17 months. We use to have phenomonal sex. The pain started to come around the ending trimester of our first child. When we were trying to conceive our second child, it hurt a little but I just shrugged it off. Sex got way better during my second pregnancy but by my last trimester, it got worst. I didn&#8217;t take exams very well either, luckily I had both c sections, so I didn&#8217;t have to put up with very many exams. After I gave birth to my second baby, a day before I got Mirena an IUD birth control put in (Aug 2010), my husband and I had successful sex. Might I add, my gyn put my on percacet to be able to put the IUD inside of me. After that sex was horrible. We continued to try after my gyn insisted that it was &#8220;all in my head, I needed to relax and that my kids were too much on my mind.&#8221; Feeling like it was all my fault, I continued to try so called relaxing. What is most confusing is that in March of 2011 we finally had one day of success and that was the last time. We started researching and asked the dr about &#8220;vaginismus&#8221; thats when he said yes you have it, go buy some sex toys and thats all I can do for you. I got a referral for another dr that was suppose to be more informative on vaginal problems, he started me on muscle relaxers. It didnt feel muc of a difference and I was tired of being 21 yrs old and on so many medications. Since then I have had my mirena removed (which might I add hurt so bad!, to try to start from scratch. I have been trying &#8220;exercises&#8221; with what I have. Unfortunately, sometimes I get depressed and feel like I dont even want to try, like its useless. It still burns as I try to do my exercises. I want to say &#8220;the heck with the doctors and medication&#8221; and buy this kit, but I&#8217;m such a tight-wad with money that I&#8217;m not sure if I want to spend so much money for it. I&#8217;m sure I eventually will, I will just have to talk myself into it.<br /> I really hope I can fix all this. My husband is very patient but I know sometimes, he just wishes it would go away just as much as I do. He works with a bunch of women that flirt with him and I know he&#8217;s very faithful and loves me to death, I just really don&#8217;t want to lose him!<br /> I&#8217;m tired of thinking about it and being depressed about it, just want it to go away!</p></div></div> </article></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-314"> <article id="comment-314" class="comment-body clearfix"><div class="comment_avatar"></div><div class="comment_postinfo"> <span class="fn">Salam412</span> <span class="comment_date"> on October 28, 2011 at 4:55 am </span></div><div class="comment_area"><div class="comment-content clearfix"><p>I am 27 years of age and recently got married.

I don&#8217;t really know how to put this, but I&#8217;ve suffered from vaginismus for 5 years now and my four-year marriage ended last year, because of this condition. Unfortunately my ex-husband wasn&#8217;t very supportive in this and wanted me to solve this on my own beacuse he didn&#8217;t feel that it was his responsivebility to deal with. God knows how many tears I&#8217;ve cried for that. I feel very unnormal and helpless. As much as I get happy for you guys that are lucky enough to have amazing and supportive husbands, I can&#8217;t help but wondering: how am I supposed to overcome this without a partners help? Is it possible to do it by yourself? It says somewhere on this website that it is, but how am I supposed to do that when I can&#8217;t even put a finger there? It&#8217;s very embarrassing and I don&#8217;t really know where to start and nobody in my family understands what I&#8217;m going trough, It really is a living nightmare!!! The thought of the future scares me and I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m ever gonna meet a man that can understand what I&#8217;m going through and help me overcome this.

I am 22 and have been married for a month. I had told my husband, before our wedding, about my fear of intercourse, and he was, and is, very patient and understanding, and even when we &#8220;fail&#8221; in my eyes, he assures me that he is very happy with me and that sex isn&#8217;t the measure of our love. We both thought it had to do with me not knowing about anything concerning sex until I had to research it on my own in our engagement months, which was shocking and new, and scared me. On our honeymoon, though, which we both approached as virgins, I freaked out a few times&#8230;dissolved in tears and frankly that&#8217;s all I can remember happening, I just kept rambling on terrified. For the first few nights of our honeymoon, I couldn&#8217;t even take any of my clothes off. The first night we were back home, I&#8217;d reached the point of being naked as long as he couldn&#8217;t see me under the covers&#8230;but then he got his clothes off and I freaked out all over again. A few nights later I was ok with it, and we tried, but the minute I felt him near the opening, the 30 minutes of foreplay arousal disappeared, I was completely tensed up, and it took all my courage not to lose my mind again. We haven&#8217;t tried as hard since then, and I have no desire to. I want to get over it because I know it&#8217;s right, and I know he really wants this, and I want children one day, but everything about inserting anything inside me freaks and grosses me out, and even touching him there with my hand grosses me out&#8230;I&#8217;ve reached the point of indifference about touching him with my hand, but I feel like it&#8217;s my brain shutting out something shocking so I don&#8217;t fall apart. And I can only touch him while he&#8217;s wearing shorts. I thought I was by myself in how I think, but it turns out I&#8217;m not, and though I&#8217;m sorry others are going through this, I&#8217;m grateful to find out I&#8217;m not alone. Although, I am scared to see how long it&#8217;s lasted for so many of you. I&#8217;m too ashamed to talk to anyone about it, at least that I know. Everyone in my community knows me because of my job and my politically active family. I talked to another woman from my other in law&#8217;s church who was a marriage counselor, before I was married, and she just said I needed to get over my fear or else he&#8217;ll want to leave me&#8230;it&#8217;s caused nightmares on the honeymoon of him leaving me, and he had to wake me up in the night from them. I hate seeing him have to go through this, and I hate feeling so low about myself and my ability to serve my husband the way I was designed.</p></div></div> </article></li><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-309"> <article id="comment-309" class="comment-body clearfix"><div class="comment_avatar"></div><div class="comment_postinfo"> <span class="fn">IMB</span> <span class="comment_date"> on July 28, 2011 at 5:41 pm </span></div><div class="comment_area"><div class="comment-content clearfix"><p>Hi, I am 18 years old.

I am a 21 year old student from the UK, and have been suffering from vaginismus for over 2 years. My partner of 5 years has been very understanding, even during the period of time that I had no diagnosis, like many of you I was fobbed off with many wrong diagnoses and downright rude attitudes of supposed medical professionals, who made me feel like I was wasting their time. I left in tears twice after being unable to complete a pelvic examination. 4 months ago I was reffered to a psychosexual councillor, who diagnosed me with vaginismus, and recommended I get dilators to help treat my problem. I am slowly getting better, and a few nights ago my partner and i managed full intercourse without me wincing or crying in pain. In fact, it even felt fun! There was of course still some pain especially upon entry, but nothing compared to the pain I wad experiencing prior to using the dilators. My feelings of hopelessness, uselessness and self hatred are being replaced by excitement for finally having a normal sex life!</p></div></div> </article></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-306"> <article id="comment-306" class="comment-body clearfix"><div class="comment_avatar"></div><div class="comment_postinfo"> <span class="fn">mm</span> <span class="comment_date"> on February 24, 2011 at 8:45 am </span></div><div class="comment_area"><div class="comment-content clearfix"><p>I am 31 years old and have never had a sucessful penetration during sex.

I was so excited &#8211; not for me, but for all those other women out there who suffer in their relationships because of this disease. You see&#8230;I was diagnosed with vaginismus over 12 years ago. It has been a long road, but I finally overcame it. In the process however, I lost my marriage and my wonderful husband. I wish we had had the resources available on this site to better inform us of this disease back when we were struggling. I ended up going through many years of therapy on my own and eventually came out of it O.K. I learned a lot about my body and my inner self, and have become a much healthier sexual person. I hope that this site is able to help women realize vaginismus is real, there is help and support, and there is a light at the end of the tunnel.</p></div></div> </article></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-290"> <article id="comment-290" class="comment-body clearfix"><div class="comment_avatar"></div><div class="comment_postinfo"> <span class="fn">CK</span> <span class="comment_date"> on January 19, 2010 at 1:55 am </span></div><div class="comment_area"><div class="comment-content clearfix"><p>I have more or less the same story as most people here, i have a fear of penetration (tampons, my own fingers, pap).

In general, many women simply purchase dilators and try to treat vaginismus by &#8216;winging it&#8217; without any kind of program or real understanding of the normal treatment process. Obviously, if they can&#8217;t insert a tampon, they will likely experience a lot of frustration in trying to insert a dilator. Physically they may be capable, but with involuntary muscle tension occurring, it becomes an impossibly frustrating effort. Also, there is a complete misunderstanding of the purpose of dilator therapy, a misguided belief that they are only trying to &#8216;stretch&#8217; themselves larger (there are elements of truth to this mostly for middle-aged and older women trying to rehabilitate atrophied vaginal walls.) Information is power, and we cannot emphasize enough the value of reading a simple, low-cost book on the subject to develop a firm understanding of the process. It makes the treatment process so much easier.</p></div></div> </article></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-280"> <article id="comment-280" class="comment-body clearfix"><div class="comment_avatar"></div><div class="comment_postinfo"> <span class="fn">Heidi</span> <span class="comment_date"> on May 12, 2009 at 9:53 am </span></div><div class="comment_area"><div class="comment-content clearfix"><p>I have such a fear of penetration (tampons, my own fingers, pap) that it makes me hate myself.

I don&#8217;t know what to do anymore.</p><p>VAGINISMUS.COM RESPONSE: Thank you for writing. Your comment illustrates a common concern for women who have not been able to do any type of insertion. It is important to understand that our process does not begin with dilator insertions. In fact, in our 10-Step process, the dilators are not even introduced until halfway through the program (this is with treating Primary Vaginismus where women have not had sex before.) In the initial steps, before insertions are even considered, there are a number of steps to learn and practice. Muscle control is paramount, and when insertions are started, they begin with cotton swabs (medical grade Q-tips), not with dilators. Dilators come much later, and the dilators are used as tools to deliberately trigger the tightening reaction. Then the muscle control and retraining exercises are applied to override the body tightening reaction. Once women are able to control the tightening reaction, the dilators will slip inside without pain. There is a process to follow there to make it a comfortable, practical transition.</p></div></div> </article></li><li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-279"> <article id="comment-279" class="comment-body clearfix"><div class="comment_avatar"></div><div class="comment_postinfo"> <span class="fn">Sarah</span> <span class="comment_date"> on April 28, 2009 at 2:25 pm </span></div><div class="comment_area"><div class="comment-content clearfix"><p>I live in the UK and last year had to have an aborion.

Sometimes the burning is so bad I can&#8217;t let my husband see my face i&#8217;m in so much pain. I went to the DR and she said to try more lube and practice our foreplay techniques but it feels like nothing works. My husband has a very high sex drive and I have virtually none and never orgasm through sex. He knows about the pain and tries to go slowly but not having sex seems to have such a bad effect on him and our marriage I have just gone the &#8220;grin and bear it&#8221; approach, but as nothing is changing it feels harder to cope with each time. I feel ashamed and a failure having waited so long for this experience. I think it is starting to make me depressed. I need to go back to my DR but it&#8217;s so hard to keep pushing when they&#8217;re not supportive &#8211; should I take my husband? I don&#8217;t even know how to find the right resources in the UK. I never used tampons when young either as I had massive problems getting them in. I have been researching the internet but only just found your site. I had read something about vaginismus before but it only said about tightness at the entrance (which I also get) but never the burning &#8211; it&#8217;s described more fully here and really seems to be what I am suffering from. I am trying to see my DR again and push for a gyny meeting. At least I know i&#8217;m not along now, but I just want to get this sorted &#8211; although I still feel fearful about humiliation of treatment but I am getting desperate so hopefully this is the start of moving through this as I would like to try for children soon but that also scares me because of this pain.
