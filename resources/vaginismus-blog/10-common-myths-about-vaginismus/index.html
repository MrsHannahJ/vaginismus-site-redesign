          <h1>10 Common Myths About Vaginismus</h1>
          <p class="blog-meta"><span class="hidden-mobile">Vaginismus.com&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;Nov 3, 2006&nbsp; &#124;&nbsp;<a href="#comments">84 comments</a></p>

          <div class="blog-article">
            <p>The following is a list of ten common myths of vaginismus:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Women who have vaginismus are frigid.</strong> Frigid is a derogatory term meaning sexually unresponsive. Most women with vaginismus are sexually responsive and deeply desire to make love. When sex always hurts or is uncomfortable it is normal to begin to avoid intimacy.</li>
              <li><strong>Vaginismus will go away on its own.</strong> Vaginismus does not get better on its own. It requires treatment. The earlier treatment is initiated the more quickly pain-free intercourse will be attained. Do not accept your situation.  We have helped many women who have struggled unnecessarily with vaginismus for decades before they sought treatment help.</li>
              <li><strong>If we just try harder (keep trying to have sex) it will happen.</strong> Continuing to attempt penetrative intercourse while there is pain only makes the vaginismus WORSE &#8211; not better. Forcing it does not help. Stop having intercourse if you are having sexual pain and seek treatment.</li>
              <li><strong>Taking special vitamins, relaxing, drinking wine, watching sexually explicit videos and/or listening to suggestion tapes all cure vaginismus.</strong> These things in themselves do not cure vaginismus. Relaxing, meditating, regular exercise, and eating healthy are all important to one&#8217;s overall health but do not cure vaginismus. Watching adult videos and dabbling in sexually explicit imagery does not help vaginismus.</li>
              <li><strong>Sex is supposed to hurt.</strong> Sex is NOT supposed to hurt. With first-time sex there may be some discomfort but ongoing sexual pain is not normal and needs to be treated.</li>
              <li><strong>My husband/partner is just &#8220;too big&#8221; for me.</strong> Although it may seem a likely reason that intercourse is so difficult is because your husband/partner is well-endowed, penis size usually has nothing to do with vaginismus. With vaginismus the vaginal muscles are tightening up (without your conscious control) so there is not enough room for the penis to enter. No matter the size of an adult woman, the vagina is designed to accommodate a fully erect penis.</li>
              <li><strong>There is no cure for vaginismus.</strong> This statement is completely false. Vaginismus is highly treatable.</li>
              <li><strong>It takes thousands of dollars to overcome vaginismus.</strong> Vaginismus treatment does not need to cost exorbitant amounts of money. We provide effective and reasonably priced resources to women worldwide.</li>
              <li><strong>All women with vaginismus have been sexually abused.</strong> There are many emotional and physical causes for vaginismus and sexual abuse is just one of them. Women who develop vaginismus often have abuse-free backgrounds.</li>
              <li><strong>Surgery will fix my problem.</strong> There is no surgery to fix vaginismus—treatment success follows a straight-forward program. In extremely rare circumstances, a woman may have an especially thick or rigid hymen or other malformation that may require minor surgery to correct, but this is the exception.</li>
            </ol>

                <p>Thank you, thank you, thank you for this Web site! After reading it countless times, my wife and I found a doctor of physical therapy very experienced in pelvic dysfunction (who would have guessed?) 45 minutes away from us. My wife has seen her once and already we are sure the doctor is helping her. Thank you again.</p>

                <p>I am 25 years old, and I have never had a physically intimate relationship. I want to use tampons and I cannot because of this problem. I though the entrance to my vagina was blocked so I went to the Dr. When she put her finger up there my vagina clamped down and I felt sore for a couple days afterward. I am so glad I found this site.</p>

                <p>I am 25-years-old and deeply affectionate, but have considered going the rest of my life without serious romantic relationships, due to my inability to experience penetration. So many times, I&#8217;ve tried and failed to have sex. Eventually, I started making up excuses to avoid getting into those situations and thought that I couldn&#8217;t be helped. I cannot express how grateful I am to come across this website. Now, I can plan to find a solution, without feeling so embarrassed about it.</p>

                <p>I was a virgin when I got married. I had a very tough hymen which had to be broken by my Gyn. I was 20 when I got married. I had two children, but intercourse was always difficult. I am now 66 and for years I was celibate due to my husband being ill. I am now a widow and have met someone in would like to be intimate with. We tried and failed because I couldn&#8217;t be entered. It feels as though something is blocking my cervix. He put me on a pillow and was able to enter a little but not all the way. Thank you for this article. I now have the name for this embarrassing condition.</p>

                <p>My wife and I have been married for 3 years, and on our honeymoon I was expecting sex to be painful for her, because I had heard that the first time is usually painful for a girl. (Although we got married at 27 we were both virgins) Since then the pain has not lessened with sex for her. It was rare in the first year for us to have sex with her not crying. We believed through advice and research that this simply meant that I was too big and more intercourse would fix our problem. Unfortunately, as I now know, sex with untreated vaginismus will cause the symptoms to worsen. Without knowing this, we kept trying, and I applaud my wife for having sex with me despite the intense pain she had for the time we&#8217;ve been married. We even had a daughter 5 months ago. However, now penetration is no longer possible at all without extreme pain on her part, therefore we have not had sex in a year. I was so despondent about this fact that I searched and searched until I found out about vaginismus. I told her about it, and when she looked it up on your website she agreed that this is spot on for her symptoms. She ordered the kit, received it in the mail, and now the book sits next to her bed, unread, and the rest of the kit sits comfortably in its case. I began reading the book, and she somewhat scolded me for reading a book that was for her.<br /> I can understand that the years of painful sex have completely destroyed any desire to have intercourse in her. I can understand that pain would make one avoid sex. I can understand all of that, but now that a cure is in sight, how do I get my wife to try to work towards that cure, when the promise at the end of the journey, is something she knows only as pain. How do you motivate someone to simply forget all they&#8217;ve known about sex, and assume that every experience they&#8217;ve ever had has nothing to do with how sex should be? It feels like our marriage is a shell of what it should be. For those of you reading this, I want you to know, if you want to fix this, it is entirely possible. But if you don&#8217;t want to fix this, please don&#8217;t get your spouse&#8217;s hopes up, and then do nothing about it. It might just be more depressing now than before.</p>

                <p>I have always had a little pelvic pain during sex but overall enjoyed a very healthy sex life with my husband but after giving birth vaginally 3 months ago, having sex is completely impossible, it&#8217;s absolute agony. I try to force myself but through this I&#8217;ve been put off every thing and I just want to cry all the time. I don&#8217;t know what to do about it. My doctor just gave me a piece of paper with stuff about vaginismus off the internet.</p>

                <p>Why is it that doctors don&#8217;t seem to know about this condition? I have been asking about painful intercourse for 30 years and was always told it was just my anatomy, and I was just small down there. I have completely lost interest in sex because it&#8217;s so unpleasant. Had just one doctor I asked known about this, I could have had a normal sex life and still be enjoying sex today. To find out that this is a condition easily treated with high success rates makes me want to scream! If this was a condition affecting men, every doctor would know all about it and there would be TV commercials for treatments. I feel like I&#8217;ve been cheated my whole life.</p>

                <p>It&#8217;s 3a.m. And I am just crying from reading all these stories. I have suffered from what I&#8217;m sure is vagismus for 13 years of marriage and 4 years of dating.. On our honeymoon my husband said &#8216; it&#8217;s like hitting a brick wall&#8217;.. I did endless bjs on him and had &#8216;partial penetration&#8217; with orgasm.And over the years he was not very sympathetic , and I was too ashamed to seek treatment from the medical field , somehow thinking that they would think I&#8217;m totally &#8216;abnormal&#8221;.. I suffered abuse ( especially emotional) but also sexual as he thought porn or 3somes would help??;( jover the course of our marriage and he had affairs throughout before he left altogether. Reading your stories though makes me realize ,that a lot if you had partners that stuck by you and even helped look for a cure.( support).. I am completely heartbroken and at 45 ,have to start a new life now,, even though , like some of you I was like .. Who could blame him?) I&#8217;m getting lots of therapy now by a very caring professional, who is giving me hope, and reading thiese accounts gives me hope too ! Sometime I will be ordering a vagismus kit as well, but right now therapist is dealing with phsicologilcal effects of the abuse I have suffered at the hands of a. Uncaring partner and she says he would have been like that had I had perfect sex&#8230;<br /> &#8212; Slowly healing and dealing in the south</p>

                <p>I am 66 years old &#8211; have enjoyed sex all my life &#8211; am post menopausal and did not have sex for about six or seven years. Am now in a relationship and am finding intercourse is very painful &#8211; more like not possible. I tried medication given to me by my doctor &#8211; but found the side-effects scary. Saw a gyno but overall they push the meds and then you are on your own. I value this relationship and I have so enjoyed sex in the past, that I am looking for help &#8230;.. I&#8217;m guessing this is vaginal atrophy &#8211; thank you for your site&#8230;..hg</p>

                <p>I am 63 and am embarrassed to say that I don&#8217;t know if I ever had sex that wasn&#8217;t painful. I remember it being painful at the beginning, and I think I as able to enjoy it during times in my life, but was never completely able to, and I think this is why orgasms were difficult, too. Since the birth of my children (at 35 and 42) and menopause,l am very sure I have almost never been able to experience penetration, and thrusting without pain. I finally had some physical therapy and noticed some improvement, but I think I tried too soon, pain returned and then I found myself too fearful to be able to try again. I would sometimes encourage my husband (of 30 years in August) to penetrate but then was so sad when it didn&#8217;t feel good that I would sometimes let him continue when I should not have done so. IT only made things worse. I am hoping that if I can follow the guidelines of this treatment (and try NOT to be too impatient), I will find some success. My gynecologist suggested the dilators and I decided to go with the books and CD to give myself the best chance. I am hopeful, but there is small voice in me that says I will never be able to enjoy sex as I would lke to.</p>

                <p>I will be 45 next week and will celebrate 18 years of marriage the week after. When we first married, it hurt a little, but we were able to enjoy each other. After 12 surgeries and a car wreck, things are different. It is so frustrating to NOT be able to enjoy sex with my husband. Many men would have given up, demanded BJ&#8217;s or just said get over it. Thankfully I have his support and we are trying to work through this together. My physical therapist who specializes in this problem is the ONLY one in the area. Why is this such TABOO? If more women knew what this was and how to treat it, maybe some other marriages could be saved.&#8211;After I recover from the car wreck, we get to start again. Thankfully he is a very patient man!</p>

                <p>I just found this website when I was trying to find out if i was to small down there. Glad to know I&#8217;m not the only one! I just tried to have a pap at my docs office the other day and she couldn&#8217;t do it, i hurt so bad i was crying. I thought maybe since i&#8217;d had sex since the last time they tried to do one, that i would be okay. I was very wrong. now i have to go to the ob and see if they have a smaller thing to use to do the pap. I&#8217;m hoping the smaller one will work, but at least now i know to bring this up before they even begin!</p>

                <p>I knew there was something wrong when my husband could not get inside me during our honeymoon. We went to the doctor after a couple of months and was scheduled for surgery since my &#8220;hymen was too thick&#8221;. After the surgery and after the doctor gave the OK, my husband and I still could not have sex. I found this website and almost everyone&#8217;s story matched mine. I finally ordered it and have been studying the book. It gets frustrating to see that women have these success stories after a couple of weeks or so, and after months I still cannot. Like many, I feel i&#8217;m not normal, and always ask &#8220;Why me?&#8221;. However, I plan to get over it, and I will. No matter how long it takes me..!</p>

                <p>Hi I&#8217;m 25 years old and recently discovered i have vaginismus. my husband and i got married last year.I was a virgin when i got married and sex has always been painful. sometimes more than others. I cry all the time. my husband tries to be patient with me, but i know he is getting frustrated, and i think he is becoming afraid of having sex with me. He&#8217;s also a big guy. i often wondered if it was his size or it was me not being able to perform, we have tired using one finger and recently 2 but even that hurts. I have a huge sexual appetite, with out penetration i get multiple orgasms,even from intense making out. I&#8217;m in tears writing this, but I&#8217;m happy to know there are more woman like me and I&#8217;m not alone. i am going to try the dilator</p>

                <p>Reading all these comments from other women just made me so emotional because I suffer from the same problems and it had been such a struggle. I am 20 years old and have tried having sex with a few people. Now that I&#8217;ve had a boyfriend for over a year it is beyond upsetting that I can not share intercourse with someone I love and plan on marrying. At first he was not very comforting about my situation. He is a virgin too and didn&#8217;t understand what was the problem, even when I told him about vaginismus he said that its fake and I am not different from any other women. That obviously hurt to hear and made me feel so alone. Not to mention my gyno just said &#8216;you are too young, sex is over rated anyways&#8217; &#8230;I wanted to go off on her but I knew I would start crying. It is only women like you all that understand. I am buying the dilators from this site and pray to God that I can overcome all of this and the nightmare can finally end. Every women deserves to experience what we all have been told is the most beautiful experience once you find someone right. And no women deserves to feel alone and depressed because she feels she is broken and different from everyone else.</p>

                <p>WOW!This site is a relief. I am a 37 year old virgin. I was told I have vaginismus 2 weeks ago. It just now settled in to brain that it is not my fault! I&#8217;m so thrilled my therapist suggested this site! I was given the dilator set, but it is missing the instruction manual. But I am figuring it out slowly but surely. Thanks!</p>

                <p>This website has been incredibly helpful and reassuring for me as a vaginismus sufferer. I found out that I had vaginismus when I was only 18 after trying to have sex for the first time, I was scared and felt very alone and like I was somehow &#8216;abnormal&#8217; to everyone else &#8211; until I found this website and the support it gives! Now two years on I am successfully on my way to curing my vaginismus with help from the dilator set (which i highly reccommend!!) and also a pelvic floor physio (she is worth her weight in gold, I would also reccommend pelvic floor physiotherapy to anyone with vaginismus). I can now say I am no longer a virgin and have had pain-free sex, just wanting to let everyone else out there that you are not alone and you shouldnt have to suffer in silence! This condition may seem impossible but it is very highly treatable and the treatment on here has been very successful for me. Thank you, it&#8217;s been so great to read about the stories on here and to know that I&#8217;m not alone! Thanks!</p>

                <p>Thank you for this website. When I first got my period when I was 13, I tried inserting a tampon but it just didn&#8217;t go in. It hurt and I didn&#8217;t want to try and insert it further because I was pretty scared&#8230; anyways, in my household, my sisters and my mother all use pads anyway so I never really thought about it further. I&#8217;m 18 now and when I was around 15/16, my friends often talked about their sex lives and getting fingered. I can only fit one of my fingers in and I tell myself over and over to relax so I can insert another but I felt so uncomfortable with the increasing burning sensation. I felt like such a freak. I recently stumbled upon this website and I&#8217;m so unbelievably grateful that I&#8217;m not the only one who suffers from this. I used to be afraid to get close to boys (I discovered something was &#8220;wrong with me&#8221; when I was 15) because I was scared of being embarrassed. Thank you, thank you, thank you!</p>

                <p>I was just recently diagnosed with vaginismus&#8230;had never heard of it before, but was hugely relieved to hear there are others out there that suffer as my husband and I do. I was referred to a physical therapist to start treatment. There are few therapits that provide this type of treatment, however for those interested its called pelvic floor and pelvic dysfuntion rehabilition. I&#8217;ve just started, but my therapist is super kind, knowledgeable on the condition, helpful, and patient! Try to find one in your area!</p>

I&#8217;m really lucky that my husband&#8217;s been very understanding and patient about this. It&#8217;s been really frustrating for us,and i was overwhelmed with shame and fear when we had numerous failed attempts at penetrative sex.now we know what we should do to improve our situation.thank you so much!</p>

                <p>I&#8217;m 21 and have been trying to have sex with my boyfriend for 2 years now. I&#8217;m losing my confidence as a person. Instantly thinking that every other girl out there would be better for him than me. It&#8217;s not helped that many doctor&#8217;s I&#8217;ve been to have not seemed to take the condition very seriously. On a positive note I&#8217;ve managed to go from not being able to insert a finger to being able to be comfortable with 2 fingers. I&#8217;ve also finally got a place with a psychosexual therapist and hoping things are going to get better. It&#8217;s a very lonely condition and so it&#8217;s good to hear the stories of other women out there who are suffering. Good luck to everyone.</p>

                <p>I don&#8217;t know what to say, this Vaginismus really describe what happen to me. I&#8217;m 27, been married for 3years, and yet never have intercourse. At 1st i thought maybe i was just scared to have sex, but then after 2 years i know it must be something. i was so embarrassed to see a doctor, so i surf from internet. I thought i suffer from yeast infection (yes still have it). so i went to see a doctor. I really don&#8217;t know how to describe my condition so i told her that i have yeast infection, and it&#8217;s hurt when it come to sex. I was so disappointed when she shocked and ask, &#8220;You&#8217;ve been married for 2 years and NEVER have sex??? How your husband feel about that?&#8221; I really felt like crying 🙁 it&#8217;s cruel.. it&#8217;s not that i didn&#8217;t want to have sex. even me didn&#8217;t know what happen to me. Then when it comes to treatment, she wanted to put the yeast antibiotic inside my vagina. I was relax when i saw she used a lubricant. But then there comes the pain. She told me relax, i tried but when it was halfway (she told me), i can&#8217;t stand it, i scream out loud, it&#8217;s so hurt i can&#8217;t imagine. so she stopped. to make it short, she gave me antibiotics to consume. And when i ask her, when should i come again, she said &#8220;when you think its necessary&#8221;. Then i knew, i would probably never go there again. So i started to seek treatment by traditional n internet. Until i found about this. Thank God, only people who suffer this knows how bad n shame is this. Thank you so much for sharing this. I will seek my treatment soon, somewhere else for sure. And i feel really relief to share my feelings.</p>

                <p>I&#8217;m a 41yr old Married mother of 2 who has been living with Vaginismus since I was diagnosed at 20yrs old. It has been a MAJOR struggle and has put a great strain on my marriage. My husband and I are still together and have been for 20yrs now but we are not truly happy because we are unable to really enjoy each other sexually. I want to overcome this but feel somewhat hopeless because I have yet to find a Doctor who is knowledgable about Vaginismus and experienced in treating women who have it. Those of you who have tried to seek out treatment know just how frustrating it can be. I&#8217;m hoping to find some help and support here. To you younger ladies I would say, PLEASE be diligent in seeking out treatment. Overcome this while your still young. I&#8217;ve been suffering with this for half of my life and I don&#8217;t want that to be you.</p>

                <p>I am 25 and have just failed to complete my first smear. I have seen docs before who have told me to get drunk to have sex. Now I know that there is a REAL condition &#8211; it&#8217;s not just me and I have a medical statement saying penetration is a no go without severe pain. Thank you for this helpful and insightful site, I am an overtly sexual being in my needs but unable to &#8216;take care of them&#8217; due to this embarrassing condition. I attended my first S&amp;M club at the young and curious age of 17 and yet&#8230; penetration still hurts! I have overcome body image issues and have no issues talking about sex, nor attempting it, yet it&#8217;s still painful. Now I know it&#8217;s not me &#8211; many normal, everyday women suffer with this and this in itself makes me feel better. I will pursue avenues and am eternally grateful for this website and your good advice.</p>

                <p>I am 32 years old and I think I have this proble becase I would definately like to get married and start a family. However I stay up nights wondering how is this possible when I get anxiety attacks just trying to insert my pinky finger into my vagina, I tried several times with tampons and that was unsuccessful, gym exams left me severly traumatized with the doctor not being able to successfully insert even the smallest speculum in me. I felt so ashamed and thought I was a freak. I really want experience an intimate relationship and the miracle of childbirth but how is this going to be possible if I cannot successfully be penetrated? I am looking forward to getting problem dealt with and resolved because I really want to have a happy life. I really get depressed when I see all my friends are able to have relationships and children and I am the only one who is stuck. I chose not to be in a relationship mostly becase of this reason. I am so desparate I will take any advice I can get. I cry every night and would love to overcome this severely distressing problem.</p>

                <p>I&#8217;m 28 and I also have this problem. I had a bike injury that caused me to bleed when I was in 6th grade. I also grew up in a family where sex was dirty, shameful, and not talked about. I also remember seeing films as a child that involved sexual abuse and rape. I think my issues could be both psychological and physical trauma.</p>

                <p>I had suffered Vaginismus &amp; had never had full intercourse. I believed I was alone &amp; that there was simply nothing I could do. However I was in a relationship of one year &amp; my partner was getting continually frustrated, I even felt it would be his right to seek sex elsewhere, as I could not provide it &amp; it was unfair that he went without, although this went against everything I believed in. One day I just felt I am going to have to try &amp; deal with this, so I started to research my condition &amp; realised it was Vaginismus. After coming across this site I decided to buy the cones, so that I could at least try them in the privacy of my own home. At first I felt it would take forever, but I didn&#8217;t give up. I used the cones every day &amp; kept a diary, eventually after the fourth cone, I knew I could accommodate a full sized penis &amp; went on to have intercourse with my boyfriend, all in the space of one month. I only wish I would have researched my condition earlier, because as soon as I knew what it was, I went on to treat it very quickly. Now it seems that the 15 years of no sex really didn&#8217;t need to be!</p>

                <p>I am so grateful that I discovered this website and this condition. I believe that I have a rather severe form of Primary Vaginismus. I remember going to the pool with my friends in middle school and not being able to swim due to a heavy period. We went to the store and bought tampons for me to try and I went through the entire box with none of them even being able to make it into my vagina. My friends were confused as to how I could &#8220;fail&#8221; to put a tampon in and told me I just didn&#8217;t know how to do it. A couple weeks ago I tried again (I&#8217;m 18 now) for a friend&#8217;s pool party and had the same upsetting results. It would burn and hurt when I tried to insert it. I have also never been able to be fingered by my boyfriend. He and I have both tried numerous times and even the pinky barely goes in and then hurts and burns. He tried inserting his penis the other day (with a condom just in case it worked) and it did not go in at all. It was like it was simply hitting a wall. Even when I got on top and tried to go down I was unable to and still got the same burning sensation. I felt so depressed and alone. This website makes me feel a lot better and I plan on seeing a doctor about this sometime this week. I hope that my doctor will listen to me and I can work towards finally fixing this. I would love to be able to go swimming anytime I want and to maybe finally be able to orgasm. Good luck to all &lt;3</p>

                <p>Perhaps I should explain more. I was pregnant 2 months after getting married n we didn&#8217;t have intercourse. We had a miracle baby n thought having a baby was easy. During our second n third year, we seldom try having sex as I was breastfeedimg n no interest due to tiredness. My hubby was a workoholic n thinking he was fat, also avoided trying sex. During the 4th year, we tried once in a while but unsuccessful. He blamed me cos he thought I find him fat n ugly. He became insecure n thought I may find another man to have sex. On my part, I started to blame him for not practicing sex n I became insecure too. On one occasion, I happened to find out that his boss told him to find another wife. I was upset but I kept quiet n I started to check on him. Then I caught him flirting with his colleagues n I thought it was really unfair cos I am trying n he not putting effort. We quarreled many times. I wanted another child n suggested we seek help from gynae. He felt that we must let nature takes it&#8217;d course. He refused to go. Then I wanted to give up n try IVF. He disagreed too. Guess what? My gynae hinted to me that men will go for affairs if they don&#8217;t have sex n suggest I get mentally prepared. I was breaking down. Nothing is helping. I can&#8217;t have sex and another child. Then I came across this website n realized that I have some of the symptoms . I am unable to have pap smear but I don&#8217;t feel Amy pain when trying sex. Now I suspect I have vaginismus. Thanks for the info. I have decided that even if one day my husband leaves me, I must solve this problem of mine. Afterall, nobody can help me but myself. I am glad there are so many ladies out there who can&#8217;t have sex like me n have succeeded. Thanks for all the sharing. Now I know I am not alone.</p>

                <p>Thanks for the info. I had a baby without intercourse and my girl is now 6 years old. my husband n I never had sex n we are virgins. He thought it&#8217;s his problem because he is too fat and I thought it was my problem because we didn&#8217;t &#8221; practise&#8221; enough. We became insecure n always quarrelled. Now I will find help. Thanks for the info on vaginismus.</p>

                <p>It all makes sense now&#8230; As a teenager, I&#8217;d never been able to insert a tampon and I thought I was doing something wrong. At my first pelvic exam when I was 21, the doctor was unable to complete the exam because I had an unusually thick hymen. I felt better knowing it wasn&#8217;t just &#8220;me&#8221;. In preparation for a spring break trip to the beach, I decided to use a mirror and insert a tampon. I managed, but when I went to pull it out, it had enlarged and it got stuck on the hymen. Mortified, I used a mirror and scissors on a small part of my hymen to get the tampon out &#8211; a terrible experience (and probably a really bad idea in hindsight)!<br />A few years later, after one unsuccessful attempt, I managed to have painful sex in spite of the thick hymen. Then a new pain emerged. My husband &amp; I just assumed it was something left over from the thick hymen, but looking to get past it. Fast forward several more years: 5 months after having a baby girl, I was having increasing pain (burning &amp; tightness) whenever we attempted intercourse. I scheduled an exam with my OBGYN, and she diagnosed it as Vaginismus and sent me to this site. It explains so much! I hope now my husband &amp; I can move forward towards having pain-free sex again (and more babies, too!).</p>

                <p>I am 21 and went to my first gynecologist visit about a month ago. I was nervous because I had never been able to use tampons and alot of times, sex would be uncomfortable because it felt like my boyfriend would &#8220;hit a wall&#8221; down there. My doctor just kept telling me to relax. No luck. She told me to try using tampons and come back in a month. Tried tampons one more time with the same results. It was comforting to find this website and know that I&#8217;m not alone. I have to go back to the doctor tomorrow and I&#8217;m and more nervous than I was last time. I&#8217;m looking for ways to relax and trying to stay positive that this time will go better.</p>

                <p>I got married 2 years ago and my husband and I have not been able to have sex because of Vaginismus. I did not know a name for it until today and am so relieved to find hope for fixing this problem. I feel like we have had a healthy sex life because we have other forms of sex 2-5 times a week, but we both deeply desire to have vaginal penetration. I am looking forward to trying the dilators and books you have developed to help people like me</p>

                <p>I am the partner of someone with vaginismus. To Ledoo and anyone out there thinking along those lines &#8211; <br />&#8220;&#8230;we had 3 surgery with no success and you are my last hope, I can’t imagine that this kind of dilators will fix the issue&#8221; <br />The dilators definitely can&#8217;t fix the issue. I wish they weren&#8217;t called dilators, because it&#8217;s not about &#8220;making the hole bigger&#8221;. It&#8217;s about gaining awareness and understanding of your pelvic floor sensations and contractions, and then EVENTUALLY, down the line, control excess tension in your pelvic floor, to the point where when you get excited you can go with the feeling and enjoy intercourse (on YOUR own terms) without tensing up involuntarily. You can&#8217;t force it &#8211; you have to work with your body and your feelings, not against them. You can&#8217;t do it mainly to please a partner, save a marriage, &#8220;be normal&#8221;, etc. It can be a long, complicated, frustrating, intense process. As a partner of someone going through it, don&#8217;t put goal oriented pressure on the process &#8211; &#8220;it&#8217;s only worth it if I get to have intercourse with you in the end&#8221;. Encourage her to enjoy the process of learning about her body and her responses, of being able to enjoy more and more sensations &#8211; like fingers or other smaller things inserted, maybe, or other types of stimulation &#8211; along the way. Take away the shame and pressure that comes with being hung up on having &#8220;proper sex&#8221; and you&#8217;re half way there!</p>

                <p>I have been married for almost 2 years and our marriage is as yet unconsummated. I came across this website recently and believe this to be the reason behind our problem. I am going to try a couple of other things first, but if those do not work, I will definitely bring this up to my OB/GYN. My husband is very loving and supportive, so I consider myself lucky. I can&#8217;t wait to get the problem fixed so that we can start trying to have a child.</p>

                <p>I am currently undergoing treatment for this condition with a sex therapist and also a physical therapist. My husband and I are making process, and what I always thought of as impossible&#8230; I see is very much possible. Please try the treatments, it is hard&#8230;but well well worth it! I am 26, and I have a few months left in my treatments. If I can overcome&#8230;anyone can!</p>

                <p>Im 24 and i hv nvr had sexual intercourse despite trying once wid my exbf&#8230; But the entering into my vagina process itself was too painful so we decided not to pursue&#8230; Since then hvin sex b4 marriage was out of the topic&#8230; And the underlying factor (unconsciously) had been pain.. However, i am a sexually active person who keeps myself active in other means (mastrubate)&#8230; Aft 4 yrs i entered into a rship and we hv decided to tie the knot. I am very comfortable wid him and i din mind tryin intercourse, only to realise the pain was still there.. I cud insert finger however i felt no pleasure&#8230; My bf felt smething was wrong. He (who is not a virgin) said sex is not supposed to be painful except for the 1st time (since im a virgin). Aft googling on the net i realised i might be hving this medical condition &#8211; vaginismus. This site has been an eye opener. If i had not knwn i&#8217;d probably think im juz too small or the pain will go away wid practice. He has been extremely supportive and i will be seeing the gyne b4 making the next move. Thank you so much for educating women like me thru ur website&#8230;</p>

                <p>(I posted about my situation on here a while ago just as I started getting help for my problem) I had vaginismus ever since I started having sex at the age of 16. A year later me and my boyfriend saw a psychosexual therapist. The pain has gone, but my complete lack of sensation internally is still there, however externally I can feel pleasure, so its not likely to be nerve damage. It&#8217;s been over a year now since we&#8217;ve been to sessions at hospital, and we&#8217;ve basically been told that there&#8217;s no hope.. Nobody knows what is wrong with me, so all I can do is wait. As me and my boyfriend have been in a relationship for nearly 3 years, and sexually active for just over 2, this is hard hitting.. I can&#8217;t stop thinking about it, but all the while I feel helpless.. The therapist asked me why this problem bothers me so much, I couldnt say much through my tears but &#8216;my confidence, I guess&#8217; and in a sentence he hit it right on the head &#8216;You feel broken, as though you&#8217;re not functioning as a real woman&#8217;.. More needs to be done about this, The pain itself is common and can be helped using dialators as a cure (it worked for me) but I have yet to find help about my absence of sensation&#8230;If anyone can help, please post a response on here..</p>

                <p>I can&#8217;t explain how I feel having found this article about vaginismus. I bought a magazine that I do not usually buy and when I got home decided to flick through it before I started dinner. I found the article and burst into tears. I am almost 37 and have two children (both conceived by my husband masturbating and ejaculating into the entrance of my vagina!) I thought I was alone in what I have been going through my whole life.<br /> I was a really small child (about 2) when they discovered that my urethra had closed and had to surgically open it. I had six of these operations before I was 10. Now it was not only the surgery that was painful, but the examinations too. In fact, I think that is what started all of this. My husband and I have been married for 5 years and together for 6. He is so supportive and he is so gentle. I look forward to finally being intimate with him without feeling like I am making excuses &#8220;again&#8221;!</p>

                <p>I&#8217;m a spiritual woman and believe you should wait to have sex until marriage. So when I got married two years ago, I thought sex was going to be the wonderful thing and then my husband and I soon realized that this wasn&#8217;t going to be possible after months of tried with no real penetration and seeing my gynecologist I basically just gave up and turned to the alternatives of oral sex. For two years I just avoided the problem because I hate doctors and when I went to one she asked me if i WANTED to have sex with my husband. OF COURSE I DO. This problem has come up again due to the fact that we desperately want to have a child and we&#8217;ve been trying for the last two months with me basically gritting my teeth through the pain. I think God has answered my prayers today. I ordered your treatment and I am desperately praying that this will work for me. We want very much to have a sexual relationship and have children. I&#8217;ve very hopeful now and I hope you do everything you can to spread the word about this. MANY gynecologists have no idea how to handle this. THank you so much.</p>

I&#8217;ve tried to research it in the library and in book stores only to find small inserts in books and no real information on it. It bothers me there isn&#8217;t more awareness and other girls are out there wondering what is wrong with them.</p>

                <p>Im 22 yrs old, and I&#8217;ve never been able to have sex. I&#8217;ve been with my partner for almost 4 years and we have tried over and over for over 2 years to have sex.<br />I think we have been through every excuse possibe&#8211;whenever we have tried having sex its just so so incredibly painful for me I have to stop him. A couple of months ago after some research on the net we came across vaginismus. I am hoping that this is the answer to our problem. Im making a gyno appt tomorrrow, and I think I am going to order the dialators.<br />My fiance is almost certain that this is what is wrong &#8211; the symptoms fit, he has been very understanding &#8211; I dont think most men would stick around in a sexless relationship for over 4 years.<br />His birthday is in November, I hope that I will be able to show my love for him in the way we have been trying to for the past few years.<br />Thank you so much for your very informative site, and the stories from people. I&#8217;ve always been scared that I would never be able to have sex.<br />This has given me some hope..</p>

                <p>After a year and two months of marriage, I still hadn&#8217;t had intercourse. I thought he was &#8220;too big,&#8221; or maybe I was &#8220;too small.&#8221; I discovered this site and ordered the kit. Within two months, I had done the exercises, read the material, and used two of the four dilators. My husband ended up leaving me (For totally unrelated reasons) and my progress was put on hold. I didn&#8217;t really have a reason to continue with the kit. Plus, he didn&#8217;t pack my kit with my things. Anyway, last month, I went to Fascinations and got a vibrator that&#8217;s the size of an average penis. After 8 days of working on it, I got it completely in. Sometimes I bleed when I do it, but it&#8217;s becoming easier. There&#8217;s still a certain point that&#8217;s painful to get past, but it&#8217;s getting better. Anyway, I just want to say that there IS hope. Also, there&#8217;s more to sex than just intercourse. My ex husband and I enjoyed outercourse a lot. You can do everything else that goes with sex and have a great time doing it. I&#8217;ve always been able to wear tampons, so my case isn&#8217;t as bad as some, but it&#8217;s still Vaginismus. I have a boyfriend now (We&#8217;re Christians, so we don&#8217;t believe in sex outside of marriage) and I&#8217;ll eventually tell him about my condition. Assuming we end up getting married, I won&#8217;t want to spring it on him on our wedding night&#8230; But, I know that with time and patience, we&#8217;ll be able to have intercourse. In the meantime, we&#8217;ll have awesome outerourse. I can orgasm at the drop of a hat and that is a bigger deal to me than intercourse.</p>

I thought it was me . the pain goes away while having sex but it is always the fear of the him entering because it was so painful. i glad to see i am not along. I going try the kit and be committed to the kit.</p>

                <p>i have been having a crap time this past year&#8230;. i have been battling depression and feel like im losing the battle. my bf has been supportive and very patient, my sex drive has decreased greatly and had started avoiding having sex because i felt uncomfortable and just didnt feel like it, then each time we did it just felt like it was getting harder and harder for anything to happen and was becoming quite painful. i went to my doctor to see what was going on and was diagnosed with vagisnimus. im only 19 and things just feel like theyre getting worse. however with the support of my partner and doctor i hope it gets better, it just feel overwhelming at the moment and i dont know where to start. i wish the best of luck to every other woman experiencing this problem and its encouraging to see evryones feedback and knowing im not the only one</p>

                <p>I am 21 &amp; my partner &amp; I have been together for 2 years. We have tried in excess of 15 times &amp; every time we try, he can&#8217;t get in there. He has used his fingers to try to &#8220;loosen&#8221; me up a little, but even 2 fingers is far too painful for me. We love eachother very much but I feel as though if I don&#8217;t do something soon, he will leave me. I am so glad to see that I am not the only one in the world with this condition! I now feel hopeful.</p>

                <p>I am so glad my condition has a name, I thought I was a freak of nature. I&#8217;m 18 and have never been able to have sex because it&#8217;s like he hits a brick wall. I went to my GP, but she just said it&#8217;s a mental thing and I need to figure out my problem, but that wasn&#8217;t a lot of help. It&#8217;s been so embarrassing not being able to be in a relationship because I know I&#8217;d have to refuse them sex. I&#8217;ve always been jealous when really young people talk about their sex lives, when they don&#8217;t even care about the other person. How could they do it and not me? Reading above comments, and reviews on the help kit, I am definitely going to order it and hope I&#8217;m cured, this has been hanging over me for a while, and I&#8217;m so thrilled that this site offers such good help and advice &#8211; as many doctors still don&#8217;t know enough about this condition. Thank you most sincerely.</p>

                <p>I am thankful that I found this site. I have been married for almost 2yrs. Both of us have been dating since we were in our teens (we petted but never had sex, wanted to keep it till we got married) so when sex didnt happen on our honeymoon, it was kinda dissappointing but thankfully, we still did have a great honeymoon. Over the past 1yr+, thgs have been great w/o sex&#8230;we are not ready to have a baby yet so not having sex is the kinda our best contraception method. However, now that we plan to try for a baby next year, we hope to be able to finally consumate. I am getting your product and I really hope it can help me, the way it has helped the other ladies here. Both of us have been through this together, w/o no one else knowing, not even our parents or best frens. So we hope this works so that no one else has to know</p>

                <p>Wow&#8230; after all these years of feeling &#8220;something just isn&#8217;t right down there&#8221; it took this site for me to see that I am NOT the only woman in this world that is suffering from this. Man I had plain giving up on everything, even on God. I was taught I could do ALL things through Christ that strengthens me, however this seemed to be impossible even for him. I know thats not right to say but that is really how I felt.. I have prayed for what felt like eternity I even had the procedure called hymenectamy and I thought that I had been delivered.I wasn&#8217;t so I had lost my faith, mainly as a result of very few sources of info and what seemed to be no cure at all. I have had so many relationships turn sour and end because of this and my current boyfriend of 4 in a half years is next. He was sooo happy about the procedure as he just knew all his patience wasn&#8217;t in vain, and of course he was disappointed to find the same results. Now my relationship is really on the &#8220;fritts&#8221; he has one foot and half of the other out the door. I told him we really He need to see other people I don&#8217;t blame him the least little bit though. Now I have a friend Im very attracted to and he is me very much so BUT what is the point. I can&#8217;t even explain my situation to him when I tried one time he swore I was lying he said &#8221; you&#8217;ve lived with a man all these years there&#8217;s no way you all aren&#8217;t having sex&#8221; so thats that. I know that I have to find a way to end our friendship now or he will later he&#8217;s already frustrated. I just want to curl up in a box and die this is the most frustrating thing in the world to have all these emotions and cant do NOTHING about. He keeps asking me, why do we get this far and then you just stop, he thinks its him. Just this morning he called to ask, &#8221; why wont you have sex with me&#8221; like he thinks I&#8217;m teasing him on purpose . I want to just go run and hide forever. One I googled everything I could about painful intercourse and everything relating. I came across this site read some of the reviews and ordered the kit I figured what did I have to loose. Well it came Monday and I&#8217;ve started to read an watched the DVD. Tonight I will start the relaxation exercises and just see what happens. I am trying to stay very positive because after all this is it, it just has to work. It does however feel good to at least know Im not the only and others have overcome . Please pray for me as I will all of you , that we all will overcome and have victory.</p>

                <p>Hi, I&#8217;m from Indonesia. My husband and I have been married for almost a year now, and we never had sex before. From the very first night we tried to have sex, there were always problem with inserting his &#8216;property&#8217; into mine and both of us were very confused and also didnt have the courage to consult to the doctor (sex is a taboo thing in our country).<br />then I search at the internet and found out about vaginismus and I forced my husband to go to the OBGYN for a help. Indeed, the doctor was very very unhelpful and rude toward my complaint!! We got even more and more confuse and sad.<br />until today, my husband found this site and it&#8217;s very relieving to read that vaginismus is actually very high treatable. we become optimist again. thanks a lot!</p>

                <p>hi..well ive been married for three years and had an unconsummated marriage.although i had heard about vaginismus i was in denial the last three years thinking that maybe its a problem which will go away on ur own. I even went for surgery with no conducive outcome..I was on the verge of losing all hope when through an internet search for vaginal dilators i bumped into ur website.It was indeed heartwarming.I researched it for hours and immediately ordered the vaginismus self help treatment kit.When i went through your book i wept because for the first time i felt someone empathize with what i&#8217;ve been through.I have started the treatment and within ten days have progressed to the second dilator and am feeling tremendously confident..I cant wait to give u all the good news once we get there.thanks once again.</p>

                <p>I&#8217;ve been married to my husband for three years and with him for ten. The only time we had sex was about seven years ago, and our marriage is unconsummated. We love and desire each other very much, and enjoy a wonderful sex life without the sex, but of course, we are both so frustrated and I have developed avoidance of the issue and he ends up holding his frustrations in. I had counselling&#8230;didn&#8217;t work, and then gave up initial dilator treatment upon moving countries. I always thought it was psychological, as all the doctors implied, but now I know it might not be due to trauma etc. as I never had any! I&#8217;ve already got the dilators and have ordered the self-help book and am determined to try again! Peace.</p>

Unfortunately we have doctor&#8217;s who do not understand this condition and think that you crazy.My husband did not love me enough to have patience for me and started having affairs and was verbally abusive towards me and always told me that I needed to go for therapy alone.He did not became part of my pain.I thank God for this website it has opened my eyes and I will surely purchase the treatment and start the healing process.</p>

                <p>Thank you for this website! I&#8217;m 20 and haven&#8217;t been able to have penetration yet&#8230; want to be able to soon. I grew up in a household where sex was considered ok, not dirty, openly talked about- so not sure where this comes from. My bf and I immensely enjoy oral sex but haven&#8217;t had intercourse because I cannot let him- it&#8217;s like my muscles just tense up so incredibly tightly. Will look into relaxing along with treatment on the site. Thank you!</p>

                <p>This website changed some of my misconceptions about vaginismus. I first came across this condition when I was doing research on painful intercourse because I couldn&#8217;t figure out why sex hurt for me.<br />The first information I recieved was that vaginismus was due to some sort of sexual trauma (which I have not suffered from) and that vaginismus is only when your vaginal walls completely block the penis from entering, which was not my case either. So I moved on thinking that I didn&#8217;t have vaginismus.<br />But I came back and found this site and I discovered that women with vaginismus can be successful with penetration but experience pain during the intercourse, and that sometimes there is no known cause for it. This changes everything! I finally have answers.<br />I think it&#8217;s also important to recognize all the levels of severity of vaginismus so other women like me don&#8217;t get mislead. You can still have vaginismus when you ARE able to be penetrated but have no pain with tampons, etc. Thanks to this site I have been given answers!</p>

I&#8217;m 24 years old and just got married 2 months ago, I waited for my husband because I wanted to be very special on my wedding night, and it was horrible, and he thought we were the only couple with this problem. When he found this website and apologies to me I started crying because I knew we were about to get help. I&#8217;m tired of crying everytime we try and I just can&#8217;t have intercourse, and it&#8217;s really hard for us, but now I can&#8217;t wait to get my books and just be able to have a normal marriage&#8230;. Thank you so much for this page, you have no idea how much it&#8217;s helping us&#8230;</p>

                <p>I am 19 years old and have never been able to have sex. I have tried several times with a couple of different partners but the pain I experienced was to much, I was left feeling ashamed and embarrassed. I often feel alone and left out when I hear friends talking about their sex lives. After finding the information on this site I am certain I suffer from vaginismus. I am still too embarressed to talk to anybody I know about this but have found the confidence to visit my GP for help. I just hope she has heard of this condition before and is understanding. The information has made me realise that I am not abnormal, as many other women suffer from this problem. Thank you for the information you have provided, it has been a great help.</p>

                <p>I discovered this site while looking up how to relax at the gynecologist.<br /> I have an appointment tommorrow an am terrified. I have had one before. My first exam was not painful becasue the doctor was compassionate. At first she couldn&#8217;t insert the speculum, but she used her finger to show me how to contract and release my muscles. I was queasy but she did it so fast. She used lubricant and slowly insterted the speculum. She did not open the speculum all the way and I barely felt it.<br />I moved and got a new gyn and she was cold and heartless. She sprung the speculum wide open even though I told her I was a virgin, I guess because of my age at the time,(I was 24) she assumed I should be able to handle it. I didn&#8217;t. I screamed and jumped across the table away from her. Her face was blank and she seemed annoyed and flatly stated I might feel some pressure. Somehow she was able to insert the speculum, I am amazed because I don&#8217;t even like to open my legs, but when she opened the speculum again it hurt.It felt tight like I was being stretched! After she left the room I cried and dressed myself. I was sore and I never went back.<br />I now have a kind gyn, but on my last visit I clenched up and she had to rush through the exam to get the pap smear and quickly remove the speculum. She explained I needed to relax my muscles, but I couldn&#8217;t. I felt embarrassed and ashamed like I was her worst and wierdest patient. I hate making the appointment every year but I have ovarian and breast cancer on my mother&#8217;s side and I know I need to do this.<br />When I saw your website I stayed up until 4am reading all the stories and comments about vaginismus. I was perplexed, I WASN&#8217;T ALONE!! I prayed and thanked God for leading me to this site. I was too embarrassed to even mention this to God, but I know as silly as it seems, I can do ALL things through Christ who strengthens me. I even managed to insert my finger a little ways inside myself after reading this to feel my PC muscles contract and release to prepare me for tommorrow.<br />It&#8217;s amazing! I am too squeamish to even look at the diagrams of intercourse on this site, I can&#8217;t stand the thought of something touching my cervix. I want to clamp my legs shut and cross them when i look at it. But I plan to order the treatment kit and mention this website to my gyn who may not know about this disorder. I pray that I will be cured before I get married some day. I used to worry that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to have sex or wear tampons properly forever.<br /> I may be a part of that 1% that has this disorder, but I don&#8217;t have to suffer anymore!!<br /> God Bless you all for your research for this site, and for the treatment kits!!</p>

                <p>Wow&#8230;I am also overwhelmed by this website. I thought I was the only one too!! I dated a guy for 5.5 years but never was &#8220;in love&#8221; with him and we tried to have sex but it never got anywhere and I thought it was becuase I didn&#8217;t love him. I am now dating a wounderful guy who I am deeply in love with and I want to share this passionate experience with. We tried once but it didn&#8217;t go anywhere and it felt like a &#8220;blockade&#8221; inside my vaginal wall. I also have a very difficult time having GYN exams. I am too scared/nervous to have them. I am currently working towards my problem and speaking to doctors. I have great optimism that things will work out and my boyfriend is right beside me every step of the way&#8230;what a saving grace!</p>

                <p>I was diagnosed with vaginismus just yesterday. I&#8217;ve been dealing with the problem for almost two years, but I never knew what it was until now. I&#8217;m so glad there&#8217;s help out there. Your site has been very helpful, and I was even pleased to read about the myths. People with or without this problem should be well educated on the subject before making assumptions. I also hope that gynecologists and other family doctors will educate themselves on vaginismus.</p>

                <p>Very, very pleased I found your website. The symptoms fit me to a &#8220;T&#8221;. I have had this for a couple of years now and even switched gynecologists because I was told that more romance in my marriage woud cure this. My current gynecologist doesn&#8217;t take my symptoms very seriously either and basically told me if I had intercourse more frequently it would get better. And both these physicans are affiliated with the Yale School of Medicine! I have ordered the dilators and am hopeful!</p>

                <p>wow, my first girlfriend had this condition FOR SURE. I did stax of reading on it and finally found a small reference in a psychology textbook. A doctor friend recommended buying dildo&#8217;s of different sizes but I guess I just wasn&#8217;t ready to go through all that. I did tell her what to do, I sometimes wander if she&#8217;s ok &#8211; I feel for all sufferers &#8217;cause their guys are included in that group!</p>

                <p>i am so very overwhelmed on finding this web site. i am 26 yrs old and have not yet experienced intercourse. i have always felt so alone and scared. i have believed that i was the only one who experienced this problem and that there was no cure or just a painful and expensive surgery to correct my &#8220;deformaty&#8221;. i am still very scared to start a treatment but am more hopeful that i can become what i like to call &#8220;normal&#8221;. thank you for having this information accessable for me. ~elizabeth</p>
