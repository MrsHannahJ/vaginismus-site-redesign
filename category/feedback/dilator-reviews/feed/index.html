				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a curable condition.<br />
After menopause I experienced vaginismus. It went undiagnosed and not understood<br />
by three different doctors. Finally I was diagnosed and sent for pelvic floor<br />
physiotherapy. The physiotherapist recommended I buy the vaginismus product and<br />
after having this condition for about six years, within six weeks I was over it<br />
and am able to lead a normal love life. I want other women to know this<br />
condition is curable even if you&#8217;ve had it for a long time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Thank you so much. I had repeatedly been to the gynecologist without any true<br />
help. My husband and I felt so lost, and when we found your website it was like<br />
someone finally understood the problem. The dilators were a god-sent! After a<br />
few months of going through each size of dilators we were finally ready to put<br />
all of the frustration behind us, and truly attempt to have sexual intercourse.<br />
We successfully consummated our marriage after a year of failed attempts, and<br />
are now having the sex life we had once only dreamed of. Thank you so much!</p>

after cancer of uterus and total hysterectomy&#8230; I found myself in the position<br />
of VERY painful sex with my husband. It just kept getting worse. I was not<br />
diagnosed, however my doctor seemed to give enough info for me to research my<br />
symptoms. So I set out on the research of this &#8220;issue&#8221; myself. Thank you so<br />
much for this product. I found after using the dilators for only 5 days&#8230; I<br />
had the best relations with my husband since 2008!!! and It was TOTALLY pain<br />
free!  Oh thank you!! This web site will be given to a few friends who have<br />
told me they have issues as well. I feel like I have my life back now. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am a 55 year old single woman. I am so grateful that I found this website and<br />
product. I wish that I had known about this common problem. I really thought<br />
that sex was never going to be a part of my life again after menopause. It<br />
would be nice if we could educate more women, but it seems that male sexual<br />
problems (how many Viagra commercials do we have to see?) are more talked about<br />
than women&#8217;s. I will recommend this product to other women that I know but it<br />
would have been great if my gynecologist had informed me 3 years ago when I was<br />
going through menopause that <em>vaginal atrophy</em> could happen to me (especially<br />
since I never had a natural childbirth (2 c-sections), was a smoker and did not<br />
have a partner during menopause). I did so much research on my own to try and<br />
figure out what was going on after he (my gynecologist) prescribed Estring and<br />
it just wasn&#8217;t enough. Ironically, after a few unreturned phone calls to his<br />
office, I went online and found this site, his office finally called back and<br />
recommended vaginal dilators right after I had ordered them . .<br />
thanks again.</p>

Well, the thing is, I just want to give you people a feedback about the dilator set.<br />
My girlfriend started using it on january 13th, regarding the treatment of vaginismus.<br />
Well, last night, that is, 4 weeks after starting the treatment, and after some foreplay with dilators number 3, 4 and 5, we achieved our first penetration. It was unbelievable. And today we did it again, without using the dilators to start. So, what we I&#8217;m trying to say is that we are another couple of people that are very satisfied with your product. Keep doing the good job. Thanks</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After reading about and realizing I had vaginismus, and after many many failed<br />
attempts, I&#8217;d almost given up on having a &#8220;normal&#8221; sex life. Until I came across<br />
your Dilator Set, that is. It arrived barely a week after I ordered it (I live<br />
in Mumbai, India so this was a very pleasant surprise). After a week of<br />
practicing, I was able to insert the 4th and 5th dilators &#8211; which really helped<br />
convince me that I&#8217;d be able to do something I&#8217;d earlier thought was impossible.</p>
<p>A few days later, I had sex for the first time, and a few days after that I was<br />
totally pain-free, incredibly happy and well, extremely satisfied!:) Thank you<br />
for a great product and excellent customer service.</p>
