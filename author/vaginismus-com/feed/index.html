				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just want to take a moment and personally thank you for doing what you do.<br />
This product saved my relationship. My husband and I have had problems having<br />
intercourse from the day we got married. While we were able to have partial<br />
inter course, it was painful and unpleasant. Our sex life was a big source of<br />
stress and pain for the both of us. While I had his support, I know my husband<br />
suffered greatly, and I couldn&#8217;t help feeling like a failure, and felt the guilt<br />
weighing down on me, knowing only I had the power toÂ fix the situation. A sex<br />
therapist diagnosed my condition, and a few months later, although we did not<br />
continue seeing the therapist, I decided to do my own research about vaginismus.<br />
At this point we were married for almost a year. I found your website and my<br />
life changed overnight. Just ordering the kit made me feel better, and more in<br />
control. Within one month we were able to have successful intercourse, and since<br />
then things have only kept improving. Now we are stronger and closer than ever,<br />
and we have you to thank. I will forever remember the impact this product has<br />
had on my marriage, my confidence and my self worth. Thank you thank you thank<br />
you!!!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> I would just like to email to thank you for some of the vaginismus leaflets<br />
received by myself. I recently had emailed you regards this as I am a women&#8217;s<br />
health physiotherapist working within Northern Ireland.<br />
I have had a great response from patients re: your leaflets and plan to bring<br />
them with me to our next training date when more of the hospitals come<br />
together.<br />
I also wondered would it be possible to have any kind of sample of your book<br />
to potentially show to patients as they may find this beneficial?<br />
Much thanks again,<br />
Kind regards</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> After six years of marriage, I was able to have sex for the first time with my<br />
husband two weeks ago thanks to your vaginismus treatment kit.  I blame my<br />
vaginismus on a conservative upbringing in a sexually repressed religious<br />
minority culture in the US.  Though my then-boyfriend and I had been sexually<br />
active via non-penetrative sex for years before marriage, the pelvic muscle<br />
spasms arose when we tried intercourse for the first time following our wedding.<br />
The shame and confusion led me to avoid seeking medical attention for years.<br />
Your self help treatment kit was exactly what I needed.  Going through treatment<br />
alone at my own pace, and watching gradual muscular improvement in myself as an<br />
athlete might see while training, were critical to success which took me six<br />
weeks from beginning to end.  I&#8217;m at a loss for words&#8230; The phrase &#8220;thank you&#8221;<br />
feels inadequate.  You have built mountains of good karma through your work.  If<br />
there is a God, God bless you.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> I started this program in June 2014. At the time I had not been able to have<br />
intercourse for 3 years. My marriage was not consummated and my husband was<br />
ready to leave. Now, 6 months later, our marriage has been consummated and we<br />
are starting over together. I suffered with vaginismus for 11 years. I had<br />
horrible pain during sex and eventually was not able to have sex at all. The<br />
disorder took a huge toll on me emotionally and physically and did the same to<br />
my partner. It eventually affected our relationship and communication, my self<br />
esteem and confidence. Vaginismus very nearly cost me my marriage. During the<br />
years, I had talked to doctors, gyns about my symptoms, but no one ever<br />
mentioned vaginismus. I found this word, diagnosis and this website on my own<br />
desperately researching what was wrong with me. After so many years of pain,<br />
frustration, failure and embarrassment, I was so relieved to find this website,<br />
a place that seemed to  finally diagnose me, but I didn&#8217;t know if anything could<br />
&#8220;fix&#8221; me, but I was willing to try anything.<br />
I took a chance and ordered the books and dilators.<br />
They absolutely changed my life and have helped salvage my<br />
marriage. I decided to also utilize professional therapy from a sex therapist to<br />
further help me, but I did the books and dilators on my own time and they, by<br />
far, are what have helped me most. It took me 6 months to get through the books<br />
and to graduate though all of the dilators, but now I can have intercourse and<br />
it is not painful. What couldn&#8217;t be done in all those years before, I did in 6<br />
months. It isn&#8217;t easy, but it is possible. If you really read the books, do the<br />
worksheets, the muscle exercises, watch the video and practice with the<br />
dilators, really follow the plan &#8211; you will see and make progress. Everyone will<br />
have their own time frame. Some will take more or less time than I did. But I<br />
honestly, can&#8217;t believe I am able to even type out this review after so many<br />
years of suffering. Thank you so so much for giving me my life and marriage back<br />
to me.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am really grateful that you created this website. Your website<br />
provides the best information about this condition. I finally found out last<br />
year that I have vaginismus. I did not know what was wrong with me and when I<br />
finally decided to go see a doctor, the first one absolutely had no idea. The<br />
second one diagnosed me with this condition. Unfortunately, soon after I lost<br />
my job and stopped treatment. I tried to start again but felt like I had to<br />
start all over again. I decided to do more research and came across your site.<br />
You have explained the condition in the best possible way and I understand what<br />
I am going through. I really hope that I can get past my fear and hope your<br />
book will help me through it. Thank you.</p>
