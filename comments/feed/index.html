After reading it countless times, my wife and I found a doctor of physical therapy very experienced in pelvic dysfunction (who would have guessed?) 45 minutes away from us. My wife has seen her once and already we are sure the doctor is helping her. Thank you again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been suffering with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) for 6 years now and have always had trouble with insertion of tampons.I then got married and proceeded to have sex for the first time...sadly it was a lot less fun than I could&#039;ve ever hoped.I remember not having sex on the first night as even having a single finger inserted hurt like hell.  On the second night I decided to just brave it, and so I let my husband have his way with me. As he started the penetration itself I felt as if there was a barrier in the way regardless, I stayed silent and after slowly inching into me further... the barrier seemed to be ripping. The pain was unbearable  (like 21 on a scale of 1 to 10) and when he started to move I felt like he was pouring alcohol onto my torn and raw flesh. Anyway I stayed silent till it was over thinking it was just that painful because it was my first. It&#039;s been 6 months now and it doesnt hurt as much...but it does still hurt like a bitch. I&#039;m also often too dry Regardless of how turned on I am.]]></description>

I though the entrance to my vagina was blocked so I went to the Dr. When she put her finger up there my vagina clamped down and I felt sore for a couple days afterward.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m 38 and dismayed, as i have never used a tampon, an extreme fear of putting anything in me. Think it will be painful, not open eg blocked shut, and won&#039;t work. I forced myself to try after many goes at 24 but it was painful and i fainted. That was only penetration, and my only ever time. I have a learning disorder si wondered if it was that, or perhaps because i was brought up in a strict religious gone, or because I read when i was 14 that sex hurts and that possibly put fear into my psyche. Whatever it is i sense that other normal grown women would be shocked, even teenagers would say in not much of an adult. I want to be able to consummate my marriage to a sexy fiance in two years time. I feel ashamed that I&#039;ve never used a tampon and will be 40.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am 25-years-old and deeply affectionate, but have considered going the rest of my life without serious romantic relationships, due to my inability to experience penetration. So many times, I&#039;ve tried and failed to have sex. Eventually, I started making up excuses to avoid getting into those situations and thought that I couldn&#039;t be helped. I cannot express how grateful I am to come across this website. Now, I can plan to find a solution, without feeling so embarrassed about it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We are 60 and have been married 40 years. I guess it was four years ago when my wife said &quot;no more, it is too painful&quot;. I did not realize that she was in pain until then. She claims the pain is due to thinning of her vaginal walls, but will not ask her doctor about it. Even if that were so, I would not want to push her to use estrogen based products as we  both fear the side effects. There is some breast cancer in her family history, She always has required more than intercourse to have orgasm but very much enjoyed receiving oral sex. Now she has no interest at all and says that I should handle my needs through masturbation. That leaves me so hungry for physical contact, but she has no interest in even holding or kissing me. So much is said about communication, but if I even try to talk about this she gets angry and defensive. I do not get try to force the issue.. I know it just leaves her depressed. I doubt this will get better, but writing may
help so  I thought I would try as getting it out  feels a little better even if no one reads this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am 22. Ive been so close to having relationships but vaginismus is something ive had since my teenage years. It is so devestating for me and I feel like im the only one in the world with this problem. I have never been able to insert a tampon up me and even any attempt at penetration/intercourse has failed. It is soul destroying. I badly need help, and I dont want to live the rest of my life as a loner who shys away from men because of my anxieties about penetration. I have come across this website in the hope that I can start from here and be cured from this condition in order to be able to have sex and in the future have children. But right now I have no partner and never allowed myself to have one because I feel ashamed and embarrassed. I feel my vaginismus is both psychological and physical. I am gutted for anyone who goes through this, it really is tough. I dont feel comfortable saying it to my GP either. I feel it is not a common enough problem in Ireland. I need help...]]></description>
