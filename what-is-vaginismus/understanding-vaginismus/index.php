              <p>Vaginismus is vaginal tightness causing discomfort, burning, pain, penetration problems, or complete inability to have intercourse. Vaginismus is also known as genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder &#40;DSM&#8208;V&#41;.</p>

              <p>Vaginismus is a condition where there is involuntary tightness of the vagina during attempted intercourse. The tightness is actually caused by involuntary contractions of the <a href="../../../vaginismus-causes/index.html#pc-muscles">pelvic floor muscles</a> surrounding the vagina. The woman does not directly control or <em>will</em> the tightness to occur; it is an involuntary pelvic response. She may not even have any awareness that the muscle response is causing the tightness or penetration problem.</p>
              <p>In some cases, vaginismus tightness may begin to cause burning, pain, or stinging during intercourse. In other cases, penetration may be difficult or completely impossible. Vaginismus is the main cause of <a href="../../../vaginismus-symptoms/index.html#unconsummated-marriages">unconsummated relationships</a>. The tightness can be so restrictive that the opening to the vagina is &#8220;closed off&#8221; altogether and the man is unable to insert his penis. The pain of vaginismus ends when the sexual attempt stops, and, usually, intercourse must be halted due to pain or discomfort.</p>

              <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
              <p>Vaginismus is a common cause of ongoing sexual pain and is also the primary female cause of sexless (<a href="../../../vaginismus-symptoms/index.html#unconsummated-marriages">unconsummated</a>) marriages. Sexual pain can affect women in all stages of life; even women who have had years of comfortable sex. While temporarily experiencing discomfort during sexual intercourse is not unusual, ongoing problems should be <a href="../../../vaginismus-diagnosis/index.html">diagnosed</a> and treated.</p>

              <h3>Types of Vaginismus</h3>
              <p><em>Primary Vaginismus</em> &#8211; When a woman has never at any time been able to have pain-free intercourse due to the involuntary contractions of the pelvic floor muscles her condition is known as primary vaginismus. Some women with primary vaginismus are unable to wear tampons and/or complete pelvic exams. Many couples are unable to consummate their relationship due to primary vaginismus. (see <a href="../../../vaginismus-symptoms/index.html">Symptoms</a>)</p>
              <p><em>Secondary Vaginismus</em> &#8211; Vaginismus can also develop later in life, even after many years of pleasurable intercourse. This type of condition, known as secondary vaginismus, is usually precipitated by a medical condition, traumatic event, childbirth, surgery, or life-change (menopause). (see <a href="../../../vaginismus-causes/index.html">Causes</a>)</p>
              <h3 class="treatable">Vaginismus is Treatable</h3>
              <p>Vaginismus is <a href="../../treatment-questions/vaginismus-treatment-success-rates/index.html">highly treatable</a> and a full recovery from vaginismus is the normal outcome of <a href="../../../vaginismus-treatment/index.html">treatment</a>. Successful vaginismus treatment does not require drugs, surgery, hypnosis, nor any other complex invasive technique. Following a straightforward <a href="../../../products/vaginismus-treatment-kit/index.html">program</a>, pain-free and pleasurable intercourse is attainable for most couples.</p>
