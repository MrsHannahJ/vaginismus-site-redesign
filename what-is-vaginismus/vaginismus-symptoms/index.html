            <p><strong>Vaginismus is vaginal tightness causing discomfort, burning, pain, penetration problems, or complete inability to have intercourse.</strong></p>
            <p>The vaginal tightness results from the involuntary tightening of the pelvic floor, especially the <a href="../vaginismus-causes/index.html#pc-muscles">pubococcygeus</a> (PC) muscle group, although the woman may not be aware that this is the cause of her penetration or pain difficulties.</p>
            <p>Vaginismus is a common cause of ongoing sexual pain and is also the primary female cause of sexless (<a href="#unconsummated-marriages">unconsummated</a>) marriages. Sexual pain can affect women in all stages of life; even women who have had years of comfortable sex. While temporarily experiencing discomfort during sexual intercourse is not unusual, ongoing problems should be <a href="../vaginismus-diagnosis/index.html">diagnosed</a> and treated.</p>

              <p>With vaginismus, the mind and body have developed a conditioned response against penetration.

                <li>Some are able to fully insert a penis, but tightness and discomfort interrupt the normal progression from arousal through to orgasm and bring pain instead.</li>
                <li>Some women are able to tolerate years of uncomfortable intercourse with gradually increasing pain and discomfort that eventually interrupts the sexual experience.</li>
                <li>Women may also experience years of intermittent difficulty with entry or movement and have to constantly be on their guard to control and relax their pelvic area when it suddenly ‘acts up’.</li>

              <p>Vaginismus has a wide range of manifestations, from impossible penetration, to intercourse with discomfort, pain or burning, all resulting from involuntary pelvic tightness. When a woman has never been able to have pain-free sexual intercourse due to penetration difficulties, it is generally classified as <strong>primary vaginismus</strong>. When a woman develops the vaginismus condition after having previously enjoyed problem-free sex, it is generally classified as <strong>secondary vaginismus</strong>.

            <h2>Primary Vaginismus</h2>
            <p><strong>When a woman has never at any time been able to have pain-free intercourse due to vaginismus tightness, her condition is known as primary vaginismus.</strong></p>
            <p>Primary vaginismus refers to the experience of vaginismus with first-time intercourse attempts. Typically, primary vaginismus will be discovered when a woman attempts to have sex for the very first time. The spouse/partner is unable to achieve penetration and it is like he just bumps into a &#8220;wall&#8221; where there should be the opening to the vagina. Entry is impossible or insertion or gynecological exams. The PC muscles constrict and tighten the vaginal opening making it uncomfortable or in many cases virtually impossible to have entry.</p>
            <div class="call-out">
              <p>Primary vaginismus is the common cause of sexless, unconsummated marriages.</p>

          </div>

            <p>When tightened, attempts to insert anything into the vagina produce pain or discomfort. Some women also experience related spasms in other body muscle groups or even halted breathing. Generally, when the attempt to put something in the vagina has ended, the muscles relax and return to normal. <strong>For this reason, medical examinations often fail to reveal any apparent problems unless the tightness occurs and is noted during the <a href="/vaginismus-diagnosis/index.html#pelvicexam">pelvic exam</a>.</strong></p>
            <h2>Secondary Vaginismus</h2>
            <p><strong>Secondary vaginismus sexual pain can affect women in all stages of life, even women who have had many years of pain-free intercourse.</strong></p>
            <p>Secondary vaginismus refers to the experience of tightness pain or penetration difficulties later in life, after previously being able to have normal, pain-free intercourse. It typically follows or is triggered by temporary pelvic pain or other related problems. It can be triggered by medical conditions, traumatic events, relationship issues, surgery, life-changes (e.g. menopause), or for no apparent reason (see <a href="/vaginismus-causes/index.html#non-physical_causes">Causes</a> for more examples). Secondary vaginismus is the common culprit where there is continued, ongoing sexual pain or penetration tightness where there had been no problem before. Most commonly, secondary vaginismus strikes women experiencing temporary pelvic pain problems such as urinary or yeast infections, pain from delivering babies, menopause, or surgery.</p>

          <div class="large-4">
            <p>The initial pain problems are addressed medically, healed, and/or managed,  yet women continue to experience ongoing sexual pain or penetration difficulties due to vaginismus. While the initial temporary pain was experienced, their bodies developed a conditioned response resulting in ongoing, involuntary vaginal tightness with attempts at intercourse.</p>
            <div class="call-out">
              <p>Left untreated, vaginismus often worsens because the experience of ongoing sexual pain further increases the duration and intensity of the involuntary PC muscle contraction.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The severity of secondary vaginismus may escalate so that sex or even penetration is no longer possible without great difficulty. Some women will also experience difficulty with gynecological exams or tampon insertion. Vaginismus can also impede a woman&#8217;s ability to experience <a href="/faq/general-questions/orgasms-problems-from-vaginismus/index.html">orgasm</a> during intercourse, as any sudden pangs of pain will abruptly terminate the arousal buildup toward orgasm.</p>

          <h2>Vaginismus is Involuntary—Not Intentional</h2>
          <p>It is important to note that vaginismus is not triggered deliberately or intentionally by women. It happens involuntarily without their intentional control and often without any awareness on their part. Vaginismus has a variety of <strong><a href="/vaginismus-causes/index.html">causes</a></strong>, often in response to a combination of <strong><a href="https://www.vaginismus.com/vaginismus-causes/#physical_causes">physical or emotional factors</a></strong>. The mystery of the problem can be very frustrating and distressing for both women and their partners.</p>
          <p>Despite the fact that vaginismus is involuntary and can strike any woman, many women feel intense shame from being unable to have intercourse and keep their pain private, feeling uncomfortable sharing their secret with anyone.</p>

        <h2>Unconsummated Marriages &amp; Impossible Penetration</h2>
        <h4>Vaginismus is by far the most common cause of unconsummated marriages</h4>
        <div class="wrapper">
          <div class="large-4 medium-6">
            <p>Couples often describe their attempts at intercourse as there being a &#8220;wall&#8221; where the vaginal opening should be. It is baffling to some women as to how this condition originated in them if they had no prior sexual contact or pelvic problems. Intercourse is impossible and painful insertion attempts reinforce the vaginismus response. The conditioned reflex continues to happen every time there is potential for vaginal penetration.</p>
            <p>The muscles act rebelliously, refusing to allow entry even though the woman may truly want to consummate and receive her spouse vaginally. Bodies do not start out as skilled reactors to sexual stimulus. Successful intercourse is learned through experience and interaction.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="large-4 medium-6">
            <p>The nervous system and musculature discover and remember what feels good, works, and what isn&#8217;t comfortable. Normally, the transition to intercourse becomes more pleasurable after the first few experiences.</p>
            <p>This is extremely frustrating. For the aroused man, it is like running into a brick wall. For the woman, it is like her body is no longer under her control.</p>
            <p><strong>Sex is an activity involving many complex conditioned responses.</strong></p>
            <p>The mind and body allow entry and learn to anticipate intercourse positively. Healthy messages result and they generate arousal in anticipation of intercourse.<strong> In a woman with primary vaginismus, the mind and body never get the chance to be trained through positive intercourse experiences.</strong></p>
          </div>
          <div class="large-4">
            <p>The process of learning how to have successful intercourse is cut short when the vaginal muscles spasm as a protective device against pain. With the absence of any direct conscious control on the woman&#8217;s part, nerves controlling the vaginal muscles react to the anticipation of intercourse as a call to tightly constrict, brace, protect, and guard against the onset of potential penetration pain.</p>

          <img src="../img/symptoms/medical-test-qa-box-en.png" alt="Question: With severe cases of vaginismus, where there has never been penetration, is it really possible to overcome?  Is there hope for unconsummated couples? Answer: Yes. Fortunately, vaginismus is highly treatable with full restoration of sexual intercourse.  Couples completing treatment fully consummate and enjoy normal, penetrative sex.  See our Reviews page for many user contributed stories of overcoming penetration difficulties.">
