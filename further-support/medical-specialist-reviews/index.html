              <h2>Great Response From Patients </h2>
              <p> I would just like to email to thank you for some of the vaginismus leaflets received by myself. I recently had emailed you regards this as I am a women's health physiotherapist working within Northern Ireland. I have had a great response from patients re: your leaflets and plan to bring them with me to our next training date when more of the hospitals come together. I also wondered would it be possible to have any kind of sample of your book to potentially show to patients as they may find this beneficial? Much thanks again, Kind regards</p>

              <h2>8 Years Later...</h2>
              <p>I have been practicing in NYC for 20 years and specializing in pelvic health physical therapy and manual orthopedics. I sent you positive feedback about your dilator set originally in 2006. Now it is 8 years later and I have found your dilator set to be one of the most valuable tools still that we recommend to patients. Those suffering from vaginisumus, pelvic floor muslce dysfunction, sexual pain, and habitual clenching patterns truly benefit from using the dliators to perform at home stretches to reduce pain and improve their daily function. Thanks again for a wonderful product and informative website.</p>

              <h2>Invaluable Resources</h2>
              <p>Thank you for writing these invaluable resources! I was diagnosed with vaginismus shortly before getting married in 2011. My husband and I are both psychotherapists, and we know professionally, and now personally, how devastating vaginismus can be.
                God greatly used your program to bring us deeper healing. I found your materials to be practical, effective and encouraging. My husband and I have recently written a book. In it we share our love story: our journey from singleness to marriage, and
                our struggles and victories with vaginismus. We pray that our story would bring couples struggling with vaginismus additional encouragement. We will continue to highly recommend all of your resources.</p>

              <h2>Most Helpful Work</h2>
              <p>I have treated women with vaginismus for over 20 years. Your products, and especially your books, are very helpful. They take the woman through a series of steps from education about vaginismus, exercises to prepare them for fixing the problem, and
                beyond. I use your materials, along with coaching women through difficult times and helping their partners understand what is happening, all with an excellent success rate. As you say, vaginismus is highly treatable. Congratulations on your most
                helpful work.</p>

              <p>Thank you so much for your generous contribution of your samples and brochures. I have been giving the patients a page I printed from your website so will use the brochures instead. I have also told physicians I work with about your product being my favorite. The handle really helps the patients to reach to use the dilators themselves better. Thank you also for your fast delivery. I received the dilator sets today. Thank you so much. </p>

              <p>Your patient education materials have been an indispensable addition to patient care in my practice. Thank you for highlighting this significant, often disabling and under-diagnosed condition. As a Gynecologic Surgeon specializing in pelvic floor

              <h2>Botox and Vaginismus</h2>
              <p>When we use Botox to overcome the vaginal spasm that occurs in vaginismus, our goal is for the woman to be able to have pain free intercourse. There is a high rate of success when Botox is used for vaginismus. Nevertheless this is not the entire answer,
                in that women who have never had intercourse are not necessarily fulfilled. Women need to understand their own bodies and what turns them on and also what does not. There is a learning process that is needed for both members of the couple.</p>

              <p>These concepts are brought to light by the excellent book written by Mark and Lisa Carter entitiled "Completely Overcome Vaginismus". In this book the authors take the patient through the many considerations leading up to possible causes of vaginismus,
                and a step by step approach to overcome vaginismus using a series of graduated dilators, and the use of dilators prior to intercourse. Additional exercises are discussed to allow the woman to develop a greater awareness of their own sexual desires.
                For the patient who wants to move more quickly through the process, botox is useful in its ability to block vaginal spasm. When Botox is used in conjunction with the recommendations in this text, patients have one more modality towards the successful
                outcome that they desire.</p>

              <p>This book as well as the dilators can be ordered from www.vaginismus.com. In our own practice this book has become a "must read" and our patients are encouraged to use the dilators after the botox begins to take effect. Generally botox is effective
                in about 5 to 7 days, but the process to achieve intercourse takes longer, generally about 3 to 4 weeks. We recommend that our patients move slowly through the process. Botox begins to wear off at about 2 1/2 to 4 months, so it is best to complete
                the process during that time frame. Once pain free intercourse is achieved, the vagina will remain dilated and usually repeat botox is not needed. At times a repeat dose is given if the patient needs a higher dose of Botox or if continued difficulties
                are encountered.</p>

              <h2>Invaluable</h2>
              <p>After a 14-year battle with vaginismus, I personally overcame this condition using the <em>Completely Overcome Vaginismus</em> program. I am now a Consultative Life Coach for women with vaginismus, coaching them through the emotional, spiritual and
                physical rough spots of vaginismus treatment via telephone. Obviously, the resources offered through Vaginismus.com have proven invaluable for both me and my clients. Using the information provided through this website, thousands of women are overcoming
                vaginismus and moving forward with their lives. I, for one, am eternally grateful for this service.</p>

              <h2>Wonderful information in a sensitive manner</h2>
              <p>I am a gyne nurse and have been married for 6 months. I still have not been able to have intercourse with my husband. Sadly, because I am a nurse in that field, I was too embarrassed to tell anyone about my problem except my mom and my ob/gyn. During
                my annual exam, she had mentioned the word vaginismus, but didn't go into any explanation&hellip;I think she assumed I knew what it was and I assumed it was merely a term for painful intercourse. After discovering your website and completing the
                reading, I realized that vaginismus is what has put me into a state of anxiety and depression for the past few years (my ob/gyn even placed me on antianxiety medication). I just ordered the kit and, although I'm extremely nervous to insert the dilators,
                I am confident that this will lead me in the right direction. I basically just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for providing such wonderful information in a sensitive manner. Every night, I feel like we need to try to have intercourse,
                and every night, it ends in tears and frustration. I hope to make a full recovery soon! I will let you know how it goes. Thank you so much!</p>

              <h2>Honors what it is to be a woman</h2>
              <p>I am a medical doctor turned counsellor interested in women's health issues in fertility and sexuality. I saw this book <em>Completely Overcome Vaginismus</em> with a client and found it to be really excellent and validated information. The illustrations
                and contents are simple and yet comprehensive. I can vouch for the fact I have learned more about Vaginismus through this book than even in my undergraduate medical training a decade ago. I appreciated the references and bibliography listed too.
                As a counsellor I like the way you have integrated the emotional aspects of sexuality and sexuality problems seamlessly into a self healing and self help approach to treating Vaginismus. I dare say I hope I can be a more sensitive counsellor to
                my clients presenting with sexuality concerns.</p>

              <p>Is there a way I can utilize this book/illustrations for educational purposes only and not for commercial profit. I would definitely cite the source and give due credit to the authors. Can you kindly advise?</p>

              <p>Please accept my congratulations on a great product and also the courage to speak about women's sexual concerns in a way that honors what it is be a woman.</p>

              <h2>Recommend kit</h2>
              <p>I was involved as a psychotherapist with a client who had suffered with vaginismus for 5 years since her marriage. The kit was excellent. She followed the exercises including writing in the journal and now describes herself as an 'overcomer'. Unfortunately,
                she did much of this without the support of her partner as the marriage was failing. However, she did have her first penetrative sexual experience with him after using the kit. I am not trained as a sex therapist specifically, and the (developing)
                country I was working in did not have any sex therapists that I could refer her to (or any therapists for that matter - that was why I was there). The kit allowed me to help this young woman in ways that working just therapeutically would not have
                done. She was so relieved to find out that her vaginismus a) had a name and b) was a common condition that could be fairly easily overcome &hellip; I am now back in U.K. and would recommend the kit to anyone with the same condition. Keep up the
                good work. </p>

              <h2>Completely Overcome Vaginismus &#8211; Reviewed by Maya Bat-Ami &#8211; DocMaya</h2>
              <h2>Review</h2>
              <h3><em>Completely Overcome Vaginismus - The Practical Approach to Pain-Free Intercourse</em><br />By Mark and Lisa Carter</h3>

              <p>The intent of the book is to provide a self-help program for women suffering from vaginismus. The book can be read alone but also can be purchased as part of a kit which includes; a companion workbook, a set of vaginal dilators, a video, and a password
                that allows the reader to participate in an on-line forum with other individuals and couples facing the challenge of vaginismus. The approach of the kit is to provide systematic desensitization exercises for the woman and the couple that include:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Education about Vaginismus through a video, book and website.</li>
                <li>Communication about Vaginismus through a restricted on-line forum for those who have purchased the kit.</li>
                <li>Normalization of issues that contribute to Vaginismus through the use of statistics and descriptors that let the woman know that she is not alone in having Vaginismus.</li>
                <li>A systematic desensitization format for the woman to use.</li>
                <li>A series of graduated dilators as well as a q-tip and tampon</li>
                <li>A systematic desensitization format for the couple to use.</li>
                <li> Journaling via use of a journal that comes with the kit so that the woman can document her progress.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>This approach is very empowering in that the woman has access to all of the information and can proceed at her own pace through the protocols that are presented. The video and books provide information that can be used by the couple to engender hope
                and provide steps that allow progress while minimizing anxiety.</p>

              <p>The kit is a wonderful addition to the armamentarium of the Sex Therapist in that it provides specific exercises for the woman and couple to do. The woman can then discuss with the Sex Therapist any issues that arise in the treatment. The couple that
                has used the kit with this Sex Therapist needed support in addressing the man's anxiety about using the kit. The woman was more willing to do the exercises but her husband was having trouble with them. The Sex Therapist was able to work with the
                couple to help the man apply the techniques of mutual pleasuring and to decrease his avoidance of the exercises suggested in the book. The multi-dimensional approach of the kit makes available on-going resources that can be used by the woman with
                vaginismus. One drawback of the book is that while it acknowledges the importance of communication with the partner, the treatment focuses on the woman. Although vaginismus is a diagnosis that applies to the woman, it is a part of the dynamic of
                the couple's sexual interactions. Given the model of women's sexuality as embedded in a psycho-relational-cultural context, it would be expected that there would be partner issues that would need to be addressed in the resolution of the vaginismus.</p>

              <p>One way to include the partner in the treatment is to predict that he or she will likely have strong responses to the protocols, thus normalizing any strong reactions that occur. A second way to include the partner is to suggest that he/she keep their
                own journal about the treatment. The Sex Therapist can then inquire about the partner's reactions and journal in such a way that lets the couple know that the relationship will be addressed.</p>

              <h2>Referring patients</h2>
              <p>Hello, I am a physical therapist working in women's health at Kaiser Permanente. I use dilators with patients in the clinic to help them work with pelvic pain issues including pelvic floor muscle hypertonicity, scarring and dyspareunia. I have been
                referring patients to your website to acquire their own dilators for home use, however it would be a great benefit to have a set in the clinic (especially the smaller diameters) so that the patients would have something to see, touch, and feel,
                to help them make a decision about which kind to buy. Is it possible to send a sample of your dilator set that I could use in the clinic in this way? Thank you.</p>

              <p>I am a retired Academic Orthopedic Surgeon. I have found two non-vaginal uses for your vaginal dilators:</p>
              <p> 1. Treatment of internal and external hemorrhoids with excellent results in a short period of time when all else had failed. Continued use advisable.</p>
              <p> 2. 14 years post successful Radical Prostatectomy for cancer, I had very annoying nocturnal urinary frequency, interrupting normal sleep. Use of your second largest dilator to gently massage the scarred prostatic bed has completely relieved this very
                troublesome problem.</p>
              <p> As a physician I wanted to pass on this information to you. Thank you and God Bless you and your work! Many thanks. You have made my life much more pleasant.</p>

              <h2>APTA Journal of Women&#8217;s Health Physical Therapy &#8211; review by Beth Shelly</h2>
              <p>In the winter 2005 edition of the APTA (American Physical Therapy Association) Journal of Women's Health Physical Therapy, author Beth Shelly, PT, BCIA-PMDB and editor Donna Edwards, PT, OCS published an unsolicited and detailed review of vaginismus.com's
                Complete Vaginismus Treatment Kit for use by patients of physical therapists and other specialists who treat vaginismus:</p>

              <h4>Vaginismus.com Dilator Set</h4>
              <p>"The set comes with a universal handle that easily attaches to the dilator end &hellip; and easily inserted by patients. Appropriate, easy-to-follow written instructions are also included &hellip; effective and priced well."</p>

              <h4>'Treating Vaginismus' - Video</h4>
              <p>"A sex therapist gives verbal instructions on the use of dilators and the video shows the patient inserting the dilators and progressing to intercourse. Overall, the instructions are good and therapists may choose to show parts of the DVD to their
                patients as it does show clearly how a patient would insert the dilators herself and shares patient concerns and success."</p>

              <h4>'Completely Overcome Vaginismus' - Book Set</h4>
              <p>"The authors are a couple who have experienced vaginismus first hand. Lisa Carter holds a degree in medical rehabilitation and psychology. Mark is an educator and writer. Book 1 explains the 10-step program to desensitizing the vagina for penetration.
                Book 2 is simply a workbook to be filled out while progressing through the program. Book 2 makes the steps simpler."</p>

              <p>"In step 1, relationship issues and other causes of dyspareunia are explored (these are explained more in the appendix). Contract relax and general relaxation instructions are also given. Step 2 identifies negative emotions associated with sex. A
                detailed sexual history is also listed. This inventory is in check list as well as descriptive paragraph form and is very well done."</p>

              <p>"Step 3 shows self discovery techniques and describes anatomy. The workbook has unlabeled pictures to test knowledge. The pelvic floor muscle (PFM) is introduced in step 4 &hellip; In step 5 the patient is guided in insertion &hellip; Step 6 progresses."</p>

              <p>"Clear instructions are given with gradual insertion &hellip; Many ideas for trouble shooting insertion are given &hellip; Advancing dilator sizes is discussed. Step 7 involved sensate exercises &hellip; Gradually getting comfortable with each other
                is explained. In step 8 &hellip; Sensate exercises are then practiced &hellip; with attention to keeping the PFM relaxed."</p>

              <p>"Step 9 explains the transition to intercourse with partial insertion and the female on top. Clear pictures show the anatomy of insertion. Many suggestions are given for making insertion succesful. Step 10 progresses to movement during penetration
                and other pleasurable components of intercourse. Appendix C gives program rationale and effectiveness including citation of 8 references with outcomes data."</p>

              <p>"<strong>The 2-book series is an excellent guide for patients and has many helpful hints for therapists as well. I can recommend use of this resource by all patients with vaginismus</strong>." [emphasis added]</p>

              <p>I have discovered your site and was thrilled to learn about your site and pass the information on. I am going to put links to your site on my site, placing them on appropriate pages where I talk of sexual pain disorders (including Vaginismus). I have
                also passed on your URL to a colleague who had taken over my sex therapy practice when I retired. Best wishes.</p>

              <h2>NYC Physical therapists</h2>
              <p>As physical therapists, we use the vaginal dilators to assist in lightly stretching the pelvic floor muscles as well as for the patients to continue their own myofascial/trigger point release at home. Patients see us between 1-3 times/week, but we
                recommend that they do their own muscle re-education at home with the dilators to maintain what we have accomplished during the PT session. Patients are very happy with the results and by giving them the dilators they feel that they are taking an
                active role in their treatment/recovery. Thank you for your help with these patients. </p>

              <h2>A much needed resource</h2>
              <p>I am a physical therapist specializing in women&#8217;s health and have several patients with vaginismus or dyspareunia. I just finished reading your book and it is excellent and very helpful. I have already recommended it to two of my patients &hellip;
                I found it very well written, easily understandable for a lay-person, and a much needed resource&hellip; Thank you very much for the sample dilators. I plan to give my patients the option to choose between your brand and the one we have stocked
                right now. I like that your dilators are tapered at the end for greater ease of insertion. I think I may prefer the size also after holding the two products side by side. I will be taking them to a talk I am giving to a support group as well. I
                like your website and continue to refer people to both the website and your products. I&#8217;ve gotten a lot of positive feedback from my patients in response.</p>

              <h2>Very pleased</h2>
              <p>Dear Vaginismus.com &hellip; I contacted you previously for a demonstration product for physical therapy courses that I teach to therapists treating dyspareunia and vaginismus. You were kind enough to send me a sample and I am very pleased with your
                product and would like to show it at my courses. I have the product in my office for patients to see right now. I wanted to see if I could get brochures from you for the classes and also talk about how participants can order the kits &hellip; The
                participants of the last course loved the dilators because they have a handle and are easier for patients to use &hellip; My patients come in early to read the book and many have asked how to get a hold of the workbook &hellip; Thank-you" </p>

              <h2>My clients have had wonderful results</h2>
              <p>I have been a sex therapist for twenty two years and am very impressed with your vaginismus kit. My clients have had wonderful results and by using this comprehensive approach they have been able to extend time between sessions achieving independent results. I have even worked by phone consults as needed. By reading about other women who have experienced the same problem they realize they are not so unusual and isolated. It's a great motivator!</p>

              <h2>Myself and my patients thank you</h2>
              <p>I have been a practicing physical therapist in NY for 12 years, specializing in pelvic pain/women's health for 5 years. My patients who have pelvic floor dysfunction, vaginismus, vulvodynia, and vulvar vestibulitis are very impressed with the design
                of your dilators. The dilators I had recommended prior were effective but the tapering of the tip of your design is easier for insertion and the handle component allows for more control. Patients are instructed the benefits of your kits during their
                treatment sessions. Your website is also a wonderful resource of information regarding help and education for patients who suffer from painful intercourse. Myself and my patients thank you.</p>

              <p>I have just seen your books from a patient and love the diagrams (plus the books). I have ordered 2 sets for our clinic and patients. I would love to use your pictures for teaching purposes with patients and their partners. Would you give me permission
                to copy them and laminate for our use? Thank you for your great web site and your products.</p>
