          <h3>Vaginismus can occur later in life following years of pain-free or pleasurable intercourse.</h3>
          <p>Vaginismus can, and frequently does occur later in life following years of pain-free or pleasurable intercourse. This form of vaginismus is called <a href="../primary-and-secondary-vaginismus-differences/index.html">secondary vaginismus</a>. <a href="../../../vaginismus-symptoms/index.html">Symptoms</a> may vary widely from simple discomfort to intense burning sensations upon penetration to inability to penetrate altogether.</p>
          <p>Sometimes the cause may not be apparent, other times it may stem from a wide range of <a href="../../../vaginismus-causes/index.html#non-physical_causes">medical/physical conditions</a> such as discomfort from inadequate lubrication to more painful experiences such as childbirth, surgery, hormonal changes (<a href="../../../resources/sexual-pain-resources/vaginal-atrophy-resources/index.html">vaginal atrophy</a>), or other health issues (see <a href="../../../vaginismus-causes/index.html">Causes</a>). It can also be triggered in response to a traumatic emotional situation, such as a spouse&#8217;s infidelity.</p>
          <h3>Evaluating When Pain First Began</h3>
          <p>Many women initially keep on having intercourse even though it hurts. Eventually, due to the pain and discomfort they may avoid sex altogether. Sometimes thinking back to when the pain was first noticed helps to discover the cause.</p>
          <p>If the initial trigger was a medical problem that has not yet been addressed, medical treatment should be sought. It is often recommended to treat underlying medical issues and then focus on resolving the vaginismus problem.</p>
