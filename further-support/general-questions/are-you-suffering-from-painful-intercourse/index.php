            <p>Are you suffering from painful intercourse? If so, you are not alone. Female sexual pain is rarely discussed in the media, at the coffee shop or even in the doctor&#8217;s office but it is a real problem for many women.</p>
            <p>Ongoing sexual pain and discomfort can be destructive to relationships and to a woman&#8217;s sense of wholeness. If pain continues, it is only natural that sexual contact will be avoided eventually leading to loss of interest in sexual intimacy altogether. Seeking help for sexual pain is just as important to a woman&#8217;s health and well-being as getting help for a tooth-ache or broken leg. The pain and discomfort are real and often worsen without treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
