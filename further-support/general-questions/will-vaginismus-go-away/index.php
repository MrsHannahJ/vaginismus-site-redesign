          <p>Since vaginismus is an involuntary, self-perpetuating condition, it will not normally spontaneously resolve unless properly addressed. The cycle of pain that is triggered with vaginismus usually continues indefinitely (and typically worsens) until the woman learns how to control and override the pelvic floor muscle triggers that tighten the vaginal opening. As much as she may like to do so, a woman cannot simply &#8220;will&#8221; vaginismus away, and it will not go away on its own.</p>
          <p>Fortunately, vaginismus treatment has high <a href="/further-support/treatment-questions/vaginismus-treatment-success-rates/index.php">success rates</a>. A full recovery from vaginismus is the normal outcome of <a href="/treatment/index.php">treatment</a>, with pain-free intercourse restored.</p>
