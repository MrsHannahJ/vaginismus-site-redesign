          <h1>Will vaginismus cause complications or impede vaginal delivery of a baby? Will the pelvic floor muscles spasm or cause problems?</h1>

          <h3>Unresolved vaginismus may present some challenges during pregnancy, but will not normally impede the actual vaginal delivery process.</h3>
          <p>During the birthing process, hormones are activated that cause a womenâ€™s cervix and vaginal canal to involuntarily dilate (widen or expand) and automatically proceed, ignoring vaginismus impulses should they be present.</p>
          <p>As a woman labors, the vaginal canal opens and stretches as the baby progresses through and exits the birth canal (with no adverse effect from vaginismus). Pain medication, such as epidurals are usually available if so desired.</p>

          <h3>Treatment Options During Pregnancy</h3>
          <p>Although childbirth is typically experienced naturally, just as it occurs for women without vaginismus, there may be difficulties with <a href="/what-is-vaginismus/vaginismus-diagnosis/index.php#pelvic-exam">pelvic exams</a> and other <a href="/further-support/pregnancy-questions/unable-to-have-gynecological-exams/index.php">pre/post-natal procedures</a> or with medical interventions during complications of delivery. Thus, women would be advised to consider resolving their vaginismus prior to delivery. Please note that a consultation with a physician is necessary to confirm the applicability of <a href="/treatment/index.php">treatment</a> options and to ensure that there are no risks posed by any treatment methods.</p>
