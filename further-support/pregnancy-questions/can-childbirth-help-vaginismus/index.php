          <h3>Unresolved vaginismus typically remains following childbirth.</h3>
          <p>Every woman is unique and every pregnancy is unique. Although every woman&#8217;s delivery experience is different, the birth process does not normally cure or alleviate vaginismus significantly. While some women, who have unresolved vaginismus prior to pregnancy, do report a lessening of vaginismus symptoms following childbirth, this is not usually the case. Unresolved vaginismus tends to remain following natural childbirth.</p>

          <h3>Stretching Alone Does Not Cure Vaginismus</h3>
          <p>Some women may experience minor improvement as a result of the birthing process, but others may see their condition <a href="../can-childbirth-cause-vaginismus/index.html">worsen as a result of additional trauma</a> or recovery pain. Usually without <a href="../../../vaginismus-treatment/index.html">treatment</a> the vaginismus remains, although each case is different and it is difficult to determine what a woman&#8217;s experience will be.</p>
          <p>It is important to realize that vaginismus is not cured or treated by simply stretching the vaginal opening. With vaginismus, the problem is not with the size of the vaginal opening, but with the involuntary tightness caused by the muscles surrounding the vagina. The vaginismus treatment process includes exercises designed to develop control over the <a href="../../../vaginismus-causes/index.html#pc-muscles">pelvic floor</a> musculature to eliminate this tightness.</p>
