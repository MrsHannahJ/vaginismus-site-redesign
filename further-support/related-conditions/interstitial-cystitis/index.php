          <h1>Interstitial Cystitis</h1>

          <p>Interstitial cystitis is a chronic inflammation of the bladder wall. Symptoms include frequency of urination, urgency and often times pelvic pain and pressure. Interstitial cystitis differs from a typical bladder, cystitis, or urinary tract infection (UTI) in that it does not appear to be caused by bacteria and does not respond to routine antibiotic treatment.</p>
          <p>Interstitial cystitis, like other pain causing conditions, may cause or contribute to problems with vaginismus and/or may coexist with vaginismus on an ongoing basis. As a result, women may need to address both conditions before they are able to fully restore pain-free intercourse.</p>
