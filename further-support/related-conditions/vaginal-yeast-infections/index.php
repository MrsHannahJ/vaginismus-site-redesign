          <p>Vaginal yeast infections are characterized by severe itching, vaginal discharge, soreness or irritation, burning sensation, and pain during sexual intercourse.</p>
          <p>Like other pain causing conditions, vaginal yeast infections may cause or contribute to problems with vaginismus and/or may coexist with vaginismus on an ongoing basis. As a result, women may need to address both conditions before they are able to fully restore pain-free intercourse.</p>
