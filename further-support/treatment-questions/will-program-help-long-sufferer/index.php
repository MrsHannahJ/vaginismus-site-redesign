          <h3>Success is the normal outcome of treatment regardless of the number of years the condition has been present.</h3>
          <p>Vaginismus has high <a href="../vaginismus-treatment-success-rates/index.html">treatment success rates</a>, even after long periods of time. Many women overcome vaginismus surprisingly quickly once treatment begins, even after decades of struggling with vaginismus. The <a href="../../../vaginismus-treatment/index.html">process</a> is generally the same whether a woman has suffered for one year or forty years, with usually only minor variations for age-related complications.</p>
          <p>Many of the participants in the <a href="../../../forum-introduction/index.html">vaginismus private forum</a> have consummated after many years or decades with <a href="../../../vaginismus-symptoms/index.html#unconsummated-marriages">unconsummated marriages</a>. It is a truly joyful experience to find freedom at any stage, but maybe even more so for those who have waited so long for first-time intercourse. It is truly never too late to find freedom from vaginismus.</p>
