          <h3>Failing Intercourse Further Complicates Treatment</h3>
          <p>Couples are encouraged to continue pleasuring each other in non-penetrative ways while the program is completed. During the initial steps of the <a href="../../../vaginismus-treatment/index.html">vaginismus treatment</a> process, we recommend that couples discontinue penetrative intercourse attempts.</p>
          <p>When intercourse is attempted prematurely, resulting in pain and discomfort, it may further entrench the vaginismus response of involuntary <a href="../../../vaginismus-causes/index.html#pc-muscles">pelvic tightening</a>. In addition, there may be increased emotional anxieties, fear of more pain, feelings of disappointment, physical complications or other setbacks.</p>
          <p>For these reasons, until control of the pelvic floor is developed it is wise to avoid potentially painful attempts at intercourse.</p>

          <h3>Cultivating Intimacy During Treatment</h3>
          <p>In the meantime, we strongly encourage couples to continue to pleasure each other in non-penetrative ways while the program progresses to maintain closeness. Some couples report that these times have built greater intimacy and ultimately enhanced their lovemaking as they learned other ways to pleasure each other.</p>
