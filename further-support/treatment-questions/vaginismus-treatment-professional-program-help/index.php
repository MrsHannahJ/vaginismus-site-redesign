          <ul>

            <li>It includes a complete <a href="../../../vaginismus-treatment/index.html#ten-steps">10-step</a> program covering all major facets of professional self-treatment (formatted for self-treatment application but allowing easy coordination for professionals focusing on key treatment areas.)</li>
            <li>The program provides an understanding of <a href="../vaginismus-treatment-success-rates/index.html">successful treatment methodology</a> widely in acceptance and practiced among treatment specialists.</li>

            <li>Treatment methodology is enhanced with empathy, understanding, and key insights gleaned from the experience of actual couples who have experienced and overcome vaginismus.</li>
            <li><a href="../../../vaginismus-treatment/index.html">Treatment exercises</a> are supplemented with detailed illustrations and strategies to further aid understanding.</li>
