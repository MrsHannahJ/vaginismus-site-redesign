          <h1>Why is it so difficult to get diagnostic and treatment help for vaginismus?</h1>
                
          <h3>Professional Help Isn&#8217;t Always Accessible</h3>
          <p>Vaginismus is sufficiently rare that many physicians have never heard of it or have little experience with diagnosis or treatment.</p>

          <h3>Some Physicians Don&#8217;t Understand the Condition</h3>
          <p>Vaginismus is a disorder that often &#8220;falls between the cracks&#8221; of general medical practices. Women may simply not get the care they need or in many cases initially experience incorrect <a href="../../../vaginismus-diagnosis/index.html">diagnosis</a>                    or <a href="../../../vaginismus-treatment/index.html">treatment</a> advice from physicians who are simply unfamiliar with the condition. As vaginismus is considered to be in the &#8220;less-than-1%-of-the-population&#8221; category, most physicians are not trained to screen for it or to even have familiarity with it.</p>
          <p>Also, as there may be no purely physical ailment that is apparent with vaginismus, some physicians feel that it is a condition that would be better suited to another health specialization. Unfortunately, as a result, some women are left feeling that the medical professions do not understand vaginismus, that the problem is untreatable, or that there are few <a href="../../../vaginismus-treatment/index.html">treatment</a> options.</p>

          <h3>Barriers in Getting Help from Knowledgeable Medical Specialists</h3>
          <p>Beyond sometimes being difficult to find professionals that are familiar with vaginismus, there are still other barriers to getting care with knowledgeable vaginismus specialists. Obtaining a proper <a href="../../../vaginismus-diagnosis/index.html">diagnosis</a>                    and quality <a href="../../../vaginismus-treatment/index.html">treatment</a> by medical specialists or therapists can be hampered by a variety of factors such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Global shortage of specialists or clinics qualified to diagnose and treat vaginismus</li>
            <li>Long waiting lists for new clients &#8211; some specialists report waits exceeding 6 months</li>
            <li>Failure to meet eligibility requirements for specialty clinics. Screening processes may be narrowly defined and disqualify some applicants</li>
            <li>Cost &#8211; specialist treatment can cost as much as $10,000 and more in some cases (making <a href="https://www.vaginismus.com/vaginismus-treatment/">self-treatment</a> the only affordable option for some women)</li>
            <li>Treatment availability windows may be inconvenient or too compressed for some women</li>
            <li>Lack of accessibility of treatment for women in remote areas or closed-country locations</li>
            <li>If there had been a previous problem with misdiagnosis or harsh treatment that resulted in distrust of medical and/or other treatment professionals then there may be an unwillingness to seek professional help again</li>
            <li>Other personal life challenges or emotions that inhibit women from seeking treatment, such as embarrassment or shame</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Choosing a Self-Help Approach</h3>
          <p>We promote and believe in the effectiveness and invaluable assistance of knowledgeable medical professionals to tailor individual treatment based on a woman&#8217;s unique personal circumstances. However, we also understand how difficult it can be to obtain the help of an informed professional.</p>
          <p>No matter how difficult, embarrassing, inconvenient or remote her situation, the <a href="../../../products/vaginismus-treatment-kit/index.html">self-help</a> program brings information and treatment directly to a woman allowing her to seek help despite her circumstances. The program empowers each woman to understand her condition and assists her in finding appropriate treatment solutions to resolve the vaginismus.</p>
          <p>While the ideal situation for couples is to have a specialist available to guide them through individualized treatment, the effectiveness of self-help is undeniable. Statistically, self-help has also been supported by studies such as Schnyder, Schnyder-Luthi, Ballinari, &amp; Blaser, 1998 and Lankveld, Everaerd, &amp; Grotjohann, 2001.</p>
