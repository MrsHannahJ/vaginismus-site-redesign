          <h1>Once vaginismus has been successfully treated can it reoccur?</h1>
          <h3>The process of overcoming vaginismus is generally permanent. Learned abilities are lifelong and prevent reoccurrence.</h3>
          <p>The process of overcoming vaginismus normally instills life-long skills that provide permanent pain-free resolution. The body&#8217;s tendency to involuntarily <a href="../../../vaginismus-causes/index.html#pc-muscles">tighten the pelvic floor</a> is overcome, and if any vaginismus symptoms ever reoccur, they are typically easily resolved with the skills learned through successfully completing treatment.</p>
          <p>Note that following the completion of a vaginismus program, some women require a short period of repeated pain-free intercourse before the tendency of the pelvic floor muscles to tighten is fully eliminated and normal intercourse body responses become completely ingrained.</p>
          <p>Following this time period, the body responses are typically completely retrained for positive intercourse experiences without any further evidence of vaginismus.</p>
