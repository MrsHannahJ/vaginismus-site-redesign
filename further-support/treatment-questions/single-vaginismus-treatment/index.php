          <h1>Can you completely overcome vaginismus if you are single?</h1>

          <h3>Vaginismus treatment can be completed while single, up to the point of being fully ready to transition to intercourse.</h3>
          <p>Being alone and dealing vaginismus can be disheartening and isolating. The embarrassment and shame of having the sexual condition leads many women to suffer privately and avoid future male partner relationships and contacts. Many single women wonder if vaginismus can be overcome without having a partner, and feel there may be little hope due to their singleness.</p>
          <p>Fortunately, <a href="../../../vaginismus-treatment/index.html">vaginismus treatment</a> can be completed while single, up to the point of being fully ready to transition to intercourse. Although vaginismus is not considered fully resolved until pain-free sexual intercourse actually takes place, women can complete all the exercises that bring them to the point of readiness. They can go through the program on their own without any partner.</p>

          <h3>Dating</h3>
          <p>Completing all of the pre-intercourse steps of the program while single helps women to enter into new relationships with increased confidence and comfort, and with a knowledge that they will no longer be defeated by the physically limiting vaginismus condition. Dating is no longer clouded with concerns over vaginismus and the inevitability of sexual defeat that would come with a more serious relationship.</p>
          <p>Single women, completing treatment, report that they experience greatly renewed self-confidence and a sense of overall freedom that they never had. Romance can actually be a positive, wonderful experience instead of brooding, discouraging anticipation of disappointment.</p>

          <h3>Support in the Forum</h3>
          <p>To help with encouragement and any emotional issues, we encourage single women beginning vaginismus treatment to find some measure of <a href="../further-support-after/index.html">support</a>. We strongly recommend that they consider joining an online support group and/or seek the assistance of a compassionate and skillful counselor/therapist/health care professional. A good place to start is in our <a href="../../../forum-introduction/index.html">Vaginismus Private Forum</a> (a forum pass comes with every <a href="../../../products/vaginismus-treatment-kit/index.html">treatment kit</a> purchase) where there are single women actively supporting and encouraging one another.</p>
          <p>Support is also available through other channels (see links on our <a href="../../../resources/index.html">Resources</a> page for more information and online groups).</p>
