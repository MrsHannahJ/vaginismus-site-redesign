          <h3>Hymen membranes typically have few nerve endings and pull apart painlessly.</h3>
          <p>With physical maturity by the time a woman reaches her late teens, the hymen will typically become a very thin, elastic membrane that may partially separate or fully pull apart. It normally has few nerve endings and correspondingly little feeling or pain when it does pull apart.</p>
          <p>If a woman still has whole or parts of her hymen remaining intact prior to <a href="/treatment/products/vaginal-dilator-set/index.php">dilator</a> insertion, there is a possibility that it either may simply stretch to the side or it may partially or fully pull apart (similarly true with the use of tamponsâ€”that the hymen may pull apart to some varying degree).</p>

          <h3>Understanding the Hymen</h3>
          <p>As the hymen pulls apart, it is generally painless and the pieces or &#8220;tags&#8221; of skin are left attached to the side of the vaginal opening. Since the tags often stay attached permanently, there is almost always some portion of the hymen that stays in place, even after insertions or full intercourse.</p>
          <p>Note that with the pulling apart of any section of the hymen, there may also be very minor temporary bleeding. If this occurs, it usually goes away quickly and painlessly.</p>
