          <h1>Article about Vaginismus in Cosmopolitan</h1>
          
          <p>The following excerpt about vaginismus was published in the August 2007 edition of <em>Cosmopolitan</em> magazine following an interview with vaginismus.com:</p>
          <h3>&#8220;Why Sex Sometimes Hurts...</h3>
          <p><strong>Feels like</strong> &#8211; Pain on entry during sex, burning, stinging, tightness, and muscle spasms in the vagina and/or lower back.</p>
          <p><strong>Could be</strong> &#8211; <strong>Vaginismus.</strong> This condition is characterized by the overtightening of the vagina muscles and causes strong, involuntary muscle spasms or intense pain during intercourse. Vaginismus can be caused by trauma from childbirth or surgery; endometriosis (uterine tissue growing outside the uterus); chronic urinary tract infections; or such psychological triggers as anxiety, stress, or past emotional or sexual abuse.</p>
          <p><strong>Solutions</strong> &#8211; Vaginismus is treatable. A variety of exercises and relaxation techniques can gradually stop the cycle of pain, including muscle-control that begins with a tampon or finger and leads to intercourse. Psychotherapy might be useful, but experts emphasize that physical and behavioral techniques often can work on their own.&#8221;</p>
