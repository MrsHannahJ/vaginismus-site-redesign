          <p>Published in the popular UK magazine <em>Bella</em>, this article references an interview with Kayleigh Morris, just one of the many women who have completed a vaginismus recovery program offered through vaginismus.com:</p>
          <p>Thousands of women suffer agony if they try to make love or even use a tampon. A simple treatment programme could change their lives.</p>
          <p>Kayleigh Morris vividly remembers the pain she felt when she first tried to insert a tampon at the age of 12. She says: &#8216;It was excruciating. It was as though someone was sticking a knife into me. I didn&#8217;t try to use tampons again.&#8217; Kayleigh also avoided sex until she was 24. Then she plucked up the courage to sleep with her boyfriend. &#8216;It was horrendous,&#8217; she says. &#8216;Pain shot up into my stomach. He only managed to get the tip of his penis in and said my vagina felt like a vice.&#8217;</p>
          <p>Kayleigh, 28, is one of 33,500 women in Britain who suffer from vaginismus &#8211; an involuntary tightening of the vaginal muscles that makes intercourse and inserting a tampon painful or impossible. It can be the result of a medical condition, such as endometriosis or thrush, or of anxiety caused by a previous painful sexual episode or pelvic examination.</p>
          <p>Happily, vaginismus can be successfully treated with a therapy programme including sex education and relation exercises along with pelvic floor exercises that help you get to know your own body better. Patients also use devices called vaginal dilators, which are introduced into the vagina in progressively larger sizes &#8211; from that of a matchstick to that of a normal erect penis.</p>
          <p>After four months on the programme Kayleigh, who&#8217;s from Manchester, felt ready to try sex again. She says: &#8216;This time it was painless. I was so incredibly relieved that I cried. It sounds silly but I really did feel that I&#8217;d become a proper woman.&#8217; [For] advice and a self-treatment pack call or visit www.vaginismus.com.</p>
